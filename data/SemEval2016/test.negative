I hope Paul Dunne blows up tomorrow only because UAB beats us in the tourney... #stillnotoverit
It's a shame it's not a historic march up the 18th on the final Sunday for Paul Dunne. Hopefully he be in as strong a position tomorrow. ...

"I guess with DJ it's a Sunday thing and not a final round thing, and Paul Dunne? Are you kidding me? #OpenChampionship"

Whether it's the 3rd round or 4th round Dustin Johnson just doesn't like Sunday's in majors!!

Looking at today's play at the #OpenChampionship You can't define Dustin Johnson's round as anything other than a choke. Tied for 2nd worst
"Oddly, Dustin Johnson may be better served to play the final round chasing not being chased. He can play to win, not play NOT to lose."

Unless Briana was as virgin- the only thing I can tell @Louis_Tomlinson is DNA test! She wouldn't be the 1st trying 2 trap a celebrity...
Just saying Briana got pregnant when she had a bf in March/April and Louis and eleanor had just broken up isn't that just fishy
ok but louis hasnt been seen with briana since like what march ???? he is never with her and he looks so uncomfortable when interviewers+
"Paps: this one if for the sun!! Briana: *stands behind Louis and poses*  So not set up, nope nope nope, not one bit"
In the paparazzi video where they take cliche for the sun you can clearly see Louis not realising that there's Briana behind him
briana may be pregnant but louis isnt the dad or atleast he is not excited about it you can obviously see it when he's been asked about it
So Briana is allowed to smoke but not allowed to take photos by fans because it may affect the baby oKAY THEN.
