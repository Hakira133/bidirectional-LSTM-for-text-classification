Paul Dunne has made less bogeys ( 2 ) than anyone else in the field thus far . I think he has a chance tomorrow #TheOpen
Apparently it's not just the final round that makes Dustin Johnson choke it's just Sunday .
Totally just realized Paul Dunne won't get a cent of the 1.8 M first place prize if he wins #TheOpen tomorrow .
Currently celebrating the 20th anniversary of Clueless and National Ice Cream Day . Be still my heart !
My brother on Dustin Johnson ' it wasn't the fourth round but he still choked on Sunday '
So is today National Ice Cream Day or next Sunday ? I want some ! #NationalIceCreamDay
Despite sitting in solo 4th , Jordan Spieth is the favorite (+275 ) to win British Open . Can still get +1960 on co-leader Paul Dunne .
Some day at #TheOpen2015 . Incredible stuff from Paul Dunne and Padraig Harrington . Baffling round by Dustin Johnson . Monday will be great .

Dustin Johnson knew it was tomorrow he was supposed to choke right , even though it's Sunday .
Really torn on the final round tomorrow . I'd love to see Day finally get his major or for Paul Dunne to take it . Still want Spieth though
Maybe Dustin Johnson (-7 ) prefers the Final Round of the Open tomorrow , Sundays have not been his best days ; (+3 ) on a day where many were -
I can think of no finer thing than for an Irishman to win the British Open tomorrow . Good luck , Paul Dunne .

wait if it's 2:44 am here in England that means CALIBRASKA IS OUT TOMORROW ASDFKSJHABAISHEBS
I can't even explain how excited I am for Calibraska . Like I don't know if I can wait through tomorrow for it .
@capitalweather am I to understand that you , as weather experts , are saying that ' Sharknado ' may be based on science that is not 100% sound ?
Sorry I can't make it in to work tomorrow got caught in a SHARKNADO
Actual #Sharknado3 forecast in real life would be like " 22% chance of Sharknado but that may vary as the hour gets later "
Why are sports news outlets tweeting about Sharknado ? I mean , c'mon . Know it's the dog days , but crikes .
Sharknado will set records for the number of watchers who have nothing better to do on a Wednesday night .
What Ebert said about the FRIDAY THE 13th series is actually true of SHARKNADO : whatever you say about one can stand for all of them .
Will say its 6th , 7th , 8th and then 365th day of Eid Bcoz still waiting for some real Eid's Enjoyment and for some Eidi . #YhBhiKoiEidHui
@ExcellencePW if I had a chance to be in Sharknado 3 I may have actually followed the rules for entry

I may watch Sharknado , but I draw the line at Lavalantula . I have my standards .
In other news , lavalantuala looks like the 4th greatest movie of all time . Too bad it won't top Sharknado 1-3 . #Sharknado3
On Saturday the makers of Sharknado bring you Police Academy : Lavarantula #Sharknado3
@Ike58Reese or just watch something more meaningful than Sharknado !! Cmon man ! May i suggest @neiltyson ' s #cosmos - feed your brain yo
@SharknadoSyfy @HarveyLevinTMZ @TMZ Great movie Sharknado is the best one yet . Where is the audition for the 4th movie I want in . Great stuff .
may i just say the lighting in Sharknado 3 could use a little work ?????
At what point do we stop talking about #Sharknado3 and start discussing how tomorrow is National Hot Dog Day ? http://t.co/1uhodKwRaf
I should work at dunkin . Get the donuts every friday .
Sharknado was funny the first time . We humored them for the 2nd . But a THIRD ? Even I'm not enough of a fan of bad movies to watch that shit .
I just need to know if the term " Sharknado " will be mentioned in an AFD tomorrow . This is important .
It's 4 am and i've just realised that Calibraska is out tomorrow . Oh .
I don't even understand how Sharknado is even a thing , let alone having a 3rd movie . The SE suck , the acting sucks , and it's so dumb I laugh
but today is one direction's 5th anniversary sharknado 3 is coming and cory tweeted about sharknado and makes me wanna cry im so emotional

Sharknado further proof we need the 2nd amendment . For yoi Seneca students its the right to own a gun .
I liked a @YouTube video from @mamexe http://t.co/5zowojmvuO Mike Tyson : Floyd Mayweather lost the fight in September 12
I dont understand the obsession with Sharknado .... watched the first two and they sucked . Im sure the 3rd one is just as bad .
All I did was look up " Kpop " and BTS was on the 3rd row . This makes me feel proud ????
@MC2000watts @MTV Evidently Kpop fans noticed it awhile ago-it may be too controversial to win now , Uptown Funk is a good choice for VOTY :)
@yuu_naoyuki this is the 3rd one . Check Sharknado and Sharknado 2 too . XD it's horrible that it's hilarious . This is a really bad movie .
Thursday is National Hot Dog day ! What would you like on yours ? Give us your ideas !
Kaylee bet I wouldn't get my tweet on sharknado and she may be right
@UsTheDuo seriously . If you two are still in Asheville on Friday , I work at Dunkin from 12-4 . West Asheville . I make a mean Coolatta .
Unscripted theater on FS2 and people are watching Sharknado . ( Well , some of it may be scripted )
Sharknado may well be the flat out dumbest thing ever to occupy a TV screen .

I'm convinced listening to the Freak Show tomorrow morning will be WAY better than that Sharknado ending . @fsmikey @FSBigBob
So wait , Twitter decides if April lives or dies ? It doesn't make sense ... But then my husband reminded me this is Sharknado . #Sharknado3
My kids look forward to the Sharknado movies , because they are awesomely horrible .... and we need April ! #AprilLives
such a good ending to SHARKNADO 3 ! YOU DECIDE BY TWITTER HASHTAG IF APRIL LIVES OR DIES ! the answer will be ... http://t.co/9xIQwd7afq
I hope Sharknado 4 starts with @mcuban saving April #AprilLives
@Mightymorph G'nite Morph and God Save The Queen & Princess Charlotte ,, & wish Prince George a happy birthday 4me when you see him tomorrow
#AprilLives No Sharknado without April . Love a chick with a sawhand
I don't care if April is dead or alive , I just can't wait for Sharknado 4
@anuparno3 @IKalmeshh_ Eid festival have only 3 days n some ppl celebrate for 2 days Monday was a last day of Eid
You'd think with as successful a franchise as Sharknado they could splurge a little on the crappy cgi for this 3rd installment .
This #GOP race is seriously getting out of hand . Who in the blue heck is John Kasich ? Or red heck , as the case may be here .
for all friends watching Sharknado tonight pls tag ur spoilers , I won't be watching till tomorrow thx

@ItsNotZ may be unpopular opinion but Ice Cube was the one with the lyrics .
I was about to tweet " I'm going to fight Frank Ocean for trolling us with an old mixtape " but then I remembered his verse on Sunday
@ayoo_aleexis @Obey_Bussh it's the 2nd part of one of his first projects when his name wasn't frank ocean ( Lonny breaux ) I don't think
Not half as ridiculous as the story of a state govt . spending hundred of millions on prayer warriors against Boko Haram ! #Sunday #Church
Why couldn't I have heard about the frank ocean spotify shit tomorrow or something :(
Perfect date would be on the beach watching the sun make the hills it's grave while @theweeknd played Rolling Stone until his fingers bled

Oh hell yeah I'm watching Naruto all day tomorrow this shit was interesting
Shouts out to the atheists who - every Sunday - rant about Christians suddenly loving God on Sundays .
One thing though : when they show Ice Cube wiring the script for FRIDAY ... that was inspiring as hell . A lot more tomorrow .

Super Eagles coach , Sunday Oliseh says it is wrong to tag some players ' home-based , ' even as they ply their trade in the domestic league .
Can't wait for Raw tomorrow night . Brock Lesnar and Undertaker both in the same arena . That's going to be awesome !
Paper Towns comes out tomorrow and guess who will most definitely be going to see it once again ? If you guessed me , you are correct .
The signs on Dunkin doors should say see you tomorrow instead of see you soon
If you stare directly at the sun , it merely burns your retinas . If you stare directly at Chuck Norris , you die .
Paper Towns comes out tomorrow and I'm going to see I after work and omg I'm so happy I could literally pee myself with excitement
I do the same things every Sunday ... Clean , wash clothes , wash my hair , cook and watch big brother

I need Dustin Johnson to remember who he is and that it's Sunday , not Thursday
Dustin Johnson is just a walking disaster on Sunday's lately .
Dustin Johnson would be -13 , tied for 5th if he simply bogeyed the first instead of puttin ' up a snowman .
Let the romance rumors continue ! In a sneak peek clip from this Sunday's brand new episode of I Am Cait , Caitlyn Jenner heads over to BFF

After going +5 on the 1st 4 holes ( including a QUADRUPLE bogey on 1 ) , Dustin Johnson is -7 for his next 8 .
I think if I wake up one day and realize that I am not married to Frank Ocean I may lose my mind .

Not often when you see Dustin Johnson going low on a Sunday
Dustin Johnson makes an eagle on 16 to move to -13 . He may not have a major , but boy is he wonderful to watch when on song . #USPGA
What a joke of a scorecard by Dustin Johnson . -4 today with a quadruple bogey 8 on the par 4 1st . 2 eagles on the back 9 . #PGAChampionship
If Dustin Johnson had pared the 1st hole he'd be 17 under right now
If Dustin Johnson makes par at the 1st instead of quad , we have a ball game . He's still fun to watch
Dustin Johnson's scorecard is ridiculous . Starts with a snowman on the 1st hole . Since then hes added 2 eagles and 4 birdies
Brawler Martin Maulers came all the way from Prince George to get #lockedin for their 20th anniversary . Can they get out before their 21st ?!
WTF !!! Frank Ocean's album has been out since June 30th and I'm just finding out !!! How ??????
I'll see Paper Towns tomorrow with some friends , can't wait
Some round from Dustin Johnson considering he started with an 8 on the 1st . Another case of what might've been for him at Whistling Straits .
#USPGA Man totally oblivious to Dustin Johnson's tee shot landing beside him at the 17th . #foreleft
Dustin Johnson is -8 over the last 14 holes . Oh for that quad on the 1st ....
Dustin Johnson and Sunday's just don't mesh well #PGAChampionship
You may dislike Floyd Mayweather but he never took a loss like this .. http://t.co/lgM52cUMye
I have no idea what to wear tomorrow to the Sam smith concert .. Need to go shopping but hate shopping . Ugh
Why is Muhammad a myth .? If not then Muslims should welcome historians to do their job . I say they are afraid of what the historian may find
Kudos to Dustin Johnson for finishing with a 69 after starting the day with a quadruple bogey . An 8 on the 1st could've led to an 80+ easy .
Dear @paddypower any chance you can pay out 7th place on dustin johnson after his comeback today #justiceforjohnsonbackers
@highoffHAZEE only thing that is guaranteed of tomorrow is the finishing off of any Christians left in the M . E ... Hazel wallah you're giving
Can't wait for Paper Towns and Nandos on Thursday with the lasses :) should shine some light over our results :)))
I know it's just preseason but do I still get free Dunkin tomorrow , or nahhhh ?
Dustin Johnson straight dominating the majors on Thursday and Friday and folding on the weekend . #boogersugarftw
Just your typical Sunday ... Spieth and Day there in the end , while Dustin Johnson falls apart in his final round
Look for Carly Fiorina to take Donald Trump on - she may win - we shall see .
What if Caitlyn Jenner is actually the worlds ultimate April Fools joke ?
Ryan Braun hit a grand slam and finished with five RBI in Sunday's 6-1 win over the Phillies .
@ajhmate Yes !!!! Lol . I think Andy mentioned her on the July 12th show and Audrey actually mentioned him on Big Brother too lol . Loves him .
Send me Lwanga's hw packet and I will buy you Dunkin tomorrow morning
@JamesFenn90 Like you say , Rory , Spieth , Rose and Day should be great to watch . If Dustin Johnson can get his head together he may join them
Dustin Johnson flies out of the blocks at every major , but he simply cannot get it right on a Sunday .
I hope tomorrow is the last RAW where Seth Rollins is WWE champion for at least a year .
Oh no not Zac Brown Band with my bestie @jmades30 #WeHateFun #Sunday #NeedStructure

Randy Orton vs . Sheamus to start the show . Interesting choice . Crowd may turn early ?
This may sound sad but I've gotten so used to not having David Wright play w/the #nymets that im ok if he doesn't return .
Randy Orton and Sheamus wrestling for the 12th time in 3 years . Hopefully make it a 12th mediocre match in a row .

Didn't Randy Orton defeated Sheamus last time they were on a PPV ? If so , then Sheamus may pull the victory . #SummerSlam
Finally watching Paper Towns tomorrow , it better do the book justice
I'm sorry , but Randy Orton is the most plain wrestler on the roster . He does nothing for me in the main event spot . 2nd is Sheamus .

2nd season epl syndrome would have been worse on kane if he left spurs . Let him suffer it there then improve later
A mong he may be , but if Kane can produce last seasons form consistently then England have a goal scorer for 10+ years

Me : went on a ride with Chels in the Corvette and got Dunkin @ettessilmarie : just went makeup shopping Neither of us are ready for tomorrow
@sloader300 What were Mason's 2 good chances ? Kane's 2nd ( was that the one creeated by Chadli , where he had 4 bodies to shoot through) ?
Mason's 1st , ball going away from goal and Mason has to use his left . Kane's 2nd chance had to pick through 3/4 bodies . Toby's header ...
Same old same old good till the last 3rd no support for Kane no width fuck knows what Poch is doing ain't got a fucking clue

Lord @J_Snyde and I killed the floor Friday when Bad Blood came on !
Nicki carried Taylor so much in that performance , tomorrow she's going to need a Nicki massage . #VMAs
Nicki may look Hollywood , but you hear every bit of New York when she opens her mouth .
Nicki did that for white media Idgaf . Nicki may act like she don't give af but she cares what the media thinks

I'll set my DVR to record the encore so I can watch Nicki's performance tomorrow .
I may hate me some Taylor Swift , Miley Cyrus , and Katy Perry but I love some Carrie Underwood because she know how to stay in her lane .
Part of me thinks Nicki is so serious about her attitude towards Miley tho . She may be cool with her but she was a little serious . #VMAs
So Meek just sat on his ass and didn't walk Nicki up to the stage ? #VMAs2015
Nicki may need a wardrobe change if she plans on winning anything else tonight . #VMAs
Miley better pick up the Hannah Montana wig again because that may be the only she'll hide from Nicki . #VMAs2015
Damn .... Miley Cyrus needs to watch it that bitch is gonna get sat on and crushed by Nicki .

Like Miley said she didn't look into everything but she thought Nicki may have been subbing her but she didn't know for sure . Her words .
@Iovemyths Watch : even tho that was Nicki responding 2 Miley putting her on blast 1st the media will make it out like Nicki picking a fight .
@naidej_ I'll tell you more tomorrow but Miley was throwing shade at Nicki and Nicki just called her out
Nicki is the most talked about tonight and will be tomorrow . No doubt !

@zaynfleek he has been happy ever since he sat next to Zayn at the Louis Vuitton fashion show (':
Basically my Sunday-Monday transition " @en_jajaja : Nicki : thank you to my pastor Nicki : SO BITCH YOU WAS TALKIN MAD SHIT WHAT UP W THAT "
Too bad its purpose was to demonize #PlannedParenthood and Muslims , making it a sort of reverse MLK march https://t.co/e7DFCDDwQO
all my friends are going to hear about tomorrow is how good Shawn looked tonight :)))
I think sure Nicki may have been joking though , if she had real beef I feel like it would be a lil scarier .
Scott Walker in interview Sunday " that building a wall along the northern border with Canada is legitimate issue that merits further review "

I wish Nicki would have flew across the stage and slapped that hoe ! https://t.co/D9dtRKeZji
I'm literally nervous for what Kanye may say tonight ... he more of a loose cannon than Nicki
Nicki is so hot and out of all the fine qualities she has , her teeth just may be my fav one . Not her butt , but her teeth .

Kanye and Nicki are the reason they may have to do away with award shows . YOU say it's about artists but you two always make it about YOU .
I'm over here tryna do this work before classes start tomorrow and Nicki is being the shady bitch queen she is and I just lost all focus
Be prepared to listen about Nicki and Miley tomorrow at school , or maybe Kanye

Kanye West may be a lot of things . But lazy and unintelligent aren't in that category . He knows what he's doing .
kinda sad you're not doing a liveshow this tuesday to talk about why kanye west is the kanye best :( @danisnotonfire
Listening to that Kanye West was like staring at the sun ... for a bit too long .
That was the most unintelligible horseshit I've ever sat through ... Kanye West is about as fun to listen to as Jimmy from South Park #VMAs

Oh blessed be , Shawn is still hotter than the sun . Bless Rider Strong ... my first non-cartoon TV crush . Have mercy * Fans face *
I'm really looking forward to adding Kanye West to our wall of presidential candidates at the office tomorrow . #VMAs

White feminism will be all over the newspapers tomorrow saying how Nicki attacked Miley . That's you call someone out !!!!
Dodgers are 4th in fewest days between no-hitters with 9 days . The White Sox lead with 1 .

If you think Kanye West would be a good president you probably scored below a 1000 on your SAT
do you know that moment when you stare at the sun and your eyes start to cry because it's so bright ? that happens to me when i look at Niall
If Kanye West comes even close to winning the 2020 election , like 5th place or higher , I'm leaving the country for Canada
This ain't the 1st day I've ever called Nicki ignorant , fuck . I'm on and off w/ her . Its simple , & I don't always like how she handle shit .
Just did the math and realized that I get to see David Price pitch live next Sunday . Cool ! #BlueJays
No really Nicki may have been the only black female artist we saw tonight
I'm going to Paul McCartney ! 2nd time in two years !
@MTV set Kanye West up w/the perfect opportunity to rebound from the Taylor Swift shenanigans & instead he sat on the ball & spinned . Unreal
Imagine if you sat next to Caitlyn Jenner at like a restaurant .... I'd die
write 2020 on your hand tomorrow if you support Kanye West running for president . #kanyewestforpresident2020 #kanyewestforpresident
When y'all can write lyrics that come close to Tupac , Ice Cube , or Eminem then and only then you may get my attention
A no no , Kanye announces he's running for president , and nicki gets crazy with Miley all in the the same night .. It's Sunday wtf
I may have just dropped two letter grades of intelligence after listening to that Kanye West rant ...
@leslimorale5 That's like saying Kim never actually said Nicki's name in Black Friday . You know who was the target .
Walks into work tomorrow morning : " Kevin how was your weekend ? " Oh it was great , Kanye west made me understand my whole entire existence
I hate you Kanye West and if you become president u may be assassinated , I hope
Kanye West , 4th member of the new day . Kan-ye sucks .

I start school tomorrow and I'm here watching Kanye rant , Miley and Nicki go at it and Tori Kelly blow the roof out of the #VMAs
Kanye West may not technically be a millennial , but I think he'd agree he's part of the GREATEST GENERATION OF ALL TIME . #vmas #vmabert
Scott Walker thinks building a wall between the US & anything is legitimate . His Wall dreams will cost taxpayers an arm , leg & 1st born .
Final thought : at some point Kanye West sat down his wife Kim Kardashian and said he wanted to run for president . What a time to be alive ...
Yeah that's just what I wanted ... hearing about Kanye West non-stop heading into a Monday . #not
i can literally feel my vision improving because of nicki and kanye !! tomorrow i will be such a good day !!
Yall act like Nicki really Finna mess up Taylor's moment ............ for the 2nd time again . #VMAs

In case anyone asks me tomorrow no I didn't see the VMA's but yes I would vote for Kanye West because of two simple reasons
What makes me sad is how tomorrow morning , the media is gonna portray Nicki as the stereotypical " angry black woman " & make Miley the victim
@GraceRosee22 3rd : Bad Blood won video of the year and she took all the women in the video up w her and said stupid shit

Just watched how Nicki called out bitch Miley Cyrus on stage at the #VMAs . May the one who has the biggest ass wins .
just took way too many pictures of Niall on Saturday but that's not a surprise
May or may not just met 80% of the ppl in Christians building
Why is Nicki always calling someone out on stage .. Bitch looks so trashy while Miley just sat there and took what she said with class
Kanye West running for president ? Trump actually being popular ? What the fuck ? This isn't reality . This is a saturday morning cartoon .

My parents just told me that I'm going to a Gay Marriage tomorrow .
@yifanlu Look at PS4 , it gives Mem leak with a TITLE_ID request ( If I'm correct ) on PS Mobile App . We may find something .
So if the 14th amendment could not protect a women's right to vote , why would it apply to gay marriage ? It wouldn't and doesn't .
Furthermore , the 14th amendment was ratified in the 1800's when homosexuality was illegal . Clearly then it's not aimed at gay marriage .

Assuming Murray pulls it out here all 4 matches on Monday will be very intriguing .
@Forever_SAFE @Laura722 @ChabbyChadamFan I think Shawn may be recast . Look at the guy MM recently started following . Looks just like him .
Murray with another huge 1st down run , 26 yds
and the reason why they went with Murray , he went 26 yards on that run . Faked half the Sun Devils out of their jocks .
#Aggies punter Kaser chopped down hard . Murray gets the ball back after penalty . 1st-and-10 at ASU's 28 .
Welp . White Sox dominating the #Royals . May be time to go back to the full strength lineup tomorrow .
And ASU tackles Murray short of the 1st down for the first time
A lot has happened while I was away sprain-spraying my ankle . Murray has taken the 1st set 6-3 in 50 mins & is up a break at 2-1 in the 2nd .
@HibernianRetro @Fritz1875 The mic batteries are running out ! Murray 3-1 up 2nd set with a break . Matchsticks needed for my eyes here !
Call on the field is reversed as the Aggies came up short of the 1st down . Murray and crew will go for it .
Could the #Aggies get more conservative on offense ? Would be hard . Turn it over on 4th-and-1 at ASU's 20 , misusing Murray for second time .
Don't forget to ask about your chance to go see Janet Jackson in Saskatoon on Monday . We've got tickets and they could be yours tonight !

Anybody know the timings for Foo Fighters tomorrow ? When do the supports come on ?
Murray loses the 1st point . Anderson playing courageous tennis from the baseline . 27 Winners to Murray's 12 #USOpen Can he keep it up ??
Just got a large iced coffee from Dunkin , which is my 6th cup of coffee ( so far ) today . Do you think that's bad ?
3 unforced errors for Andy Murray against 17 forAnderson yet Murray chucks away the 1st set with a careless double fault in the tie break .

This Red Sox team , this one , start over in May they win the pennant and good chance at WORLD SERIES .......... GO SOX
I'm afraid of Murray though ... He beat Belluci with ease in the 3rd round . Kevin's strong point is his serves !
Murray is so flat atm , if Anderson can get inspired at the start of the 2nd he can take control of this match .
Rare i walk away from a match but big day tomorrow so i need my sleep . Shout loud Murray fans #BacktheBrits #USOpen
" Gay marriage isn't the law . " Yes , it is . It was interpreted by the SCOTUS as such in accordance with rights granted by the 14th Amendment .
Anderson now has the confidence to take rips at the Murray 2nd serve . Time to take off a few mph and up the first serve percentage Andrew

Not the easiest of shots , but Murray may end up really regretting hitting it long to fall down 0-2 in the 2nd set .
Absolutely mortified and gutted that Sam Smith may be doing the new Bond song :(
Haha I'm going to see Foo Fighters tomorrow Jesus Christ that's just hit me
It may just be me focusing on the losses , but Murray's tie-break record seems shite in my head , in big games at least .
Booo , Murray gets broke early in the 2nd set . It's not as if he's playing bad , Anderson is playing exceptional tennis here . #USOpen
Not the best start to the 2nd set from Murray , but our print editor is more focused on the fact that apparently both players " look scruffy "
Murray's serve broken in 1st service game 2nd set . I'm not watching any more . He does my head in at times doing everything the hard way !
Murray a set down and 3-0 down in the 2nd set and bookies are laying Murray at Evens ? Ridiculous
@SkySportsTennis Murray's career is characterised by a pathetic 2nd serve and an unwillingness to be offensive unless he's playing Djokovic
1 set up and has already broken Murray in the 2nd . This is beautiful from Kevin
@DareToHart i'm not a huge fan myself but you know Murray will probably comeback in the 3rd & 4th set knowing him .
Come on Murray dig deep ... I'm going to be tired for work tomorrow if I have to stay up for a 5-setter @SkySportsTennis
ANDERSON versus MURRAY : Anderson 1 set ahead , now 2nd set . 3games ahead . 76 31 Murray just kept his game .
Looks like Murray is gonna have to do it the hard way again ! 1 set down , 3-1 in the 2nd set ! #ustennisopen
@tgawd____ trash OL ? Theyve looked excellent so far . Trash RBs ? J-Stew ran for 486 yards in the final 5 games last season , 2nd only to Murray
@ChiKidChris17 picking MVP in July is stupid .. wow were you marking off the days on your I luv Kris Bryant calendar to retweet this ? lol
I will wait for the weigh in . Rousey changed her body too much and may have too many things on her plate . I'll know my bet after weigh in
Murray has this . He may not have it at the moment but I'm not worried #USOpen #murray
Anderson's 1st serve goes off in that game but Murray cant take advantage . Anderson now leads 4-1 in the 2nd set #USOpen
I counted five tight points from Anderson in that game , may have been more . Gets a slice of fortune with Murray netting the BH . Holds for 41
@Michael_Fabiano Help ! Should I trade Gore for Murray ? I have Gore ( I drafted him 4th round ) but was offered Murray ( went in the 1st round ) .
Murray struggling at moment but I think he'll come strong in 3rd & 4th set to take it to decider #USOpen2015
Super super super excited about gay pride on the 19th too mf hype .
If Murray loses this 2nd set I'm pretty sure he won't win this .
Niall's always thought the warmth of Liam's smile would make the sun feel cold and lifeless . [ tries to smile through the tears ]

Murray get his 1st break of the match to stay in this 2nd set 2-5 . Can the No . 3 seed continue to turn things around ? #USOpen #ESPNTennis

A good hold from Murray . 5-3 in 2nd . How is Anderson's head coping with this now ?
@notzeev IKR , gonna be me tomorrow night " Hi Costco , Naruto ready for work , believe it ! "
Murray down a set and losing 5-2 in the 2nd set to the 6'8 Anderson . Hard to beat the big hitters when they're serving at their best .
Murray holds to 30 and now Anderson leads 5-3 in the 2nd set . Anderson will serve for the set for a 2nd time #USOpen
Last two service games started well only to be whittled away at . Still , Murray wins second game on the trot to make it 3-5 in 2nd set .

Finally , on the 5th attempt , Anderson wins the second set 6-3 , serving his 12th ace for the match to lead 2 sets to love against Murray .
Microphone picking up Murray's F bomb at the sit down after the 2nd set ...
4th set point in this game and challenge called in . Anderson 2-0 sets . Murray much more promising at the end of the 2nd . He's not out yet !
Camera closes in on Murray in his chair after losing 2nd set and he's dropping F bombs like they're going out of fashion . Brilliant . #USOpen
I'm sure Murray will win the 3rd set but not sure if he would win the match .
Murray two sets to love down . Think the broadcaster may want to turn the volume down , quiet a few F's coming from Murray ! #USOpen2015
What an effort from Murray in that 2nd set . Got to take the momentum from the last few games into the 3rd . #USOpen
Murray needs to send for Thunderbird One here . Two sets down for the 2nd time . Surely he can't do it again , can he ? #usopen2015 #murray
pondering which wine to open for the 3rd set , @kevinanderson18 2-0 up against Murray #USOpen #stellenbosch GO KEVIN !!
Murray with a splendid array of swear words at the end of the 2nd set . Sitting there with the commentator having to say , " sorry . sorry . "

Dear Twitterverse , may I please have a gif of Murray's F-bombs into the ESPN camera ? I need it for future Mondays . Pls and thanks .
@UltimateTennis_ he better close it in 3 , not making much 1st serves and Murray seems winning all 2nd serves .. important serve game to start ?
Anderson takes a toilet break . He's up 2 sets but doesn't really have the momentum . Murray finished 2nd set stronger .
Anderson survives a test , and now has 2 sets up on Murray . Can the Brit pull off a 2nd 0-2 set comeback ?
Murray on the verge of being Scottish again for the 2nd time in a week .......
Thursday will mark Tom Brady's 14th consecutive opening day start , the largest active streak in the NFL ! http://t.co/DcyQ7M9NKL

Murray always struggles on Louis Armstrong . How pivotal was that person disrupting his serve causing him to lose his mini break in the 1st ?
Andy broken to start the 3rd set ; still complaining to chair ump that 5 minutes is excessive bathroom usage time . Murray's so done . #USOpen
Tomorrow is going to be my tenth time seeing Shawn perform , I'm so lucky to be able to even once , this is so insane

ESPN announces " We're going to be here for awhile tonight " -- Murray looks to run away with the 3rd set . up 3-1 , with the serve .
Murray is pissed here and in the march ! Hope he pulls it off #USOpen
Although it's hard to tell , since I only have radio commentary . May just be that Anderson is choking badly , not Murray playing better .
Just as I say how good Anderson has been , Murray goes 3-1 up in the 3rd . Of course . #USOpen

Murray now holds to love and he levels the 4th set at 5-5 . Pressure straight back on Anderson . His longest match at the Open #USOpen
5-5 in the 4th set between Murray & Anderson This one's over the 4hr mark http://t.co/UNLVTWvp5i #USOpen #bbctennis http://t.co/VvnZ4WEe70
Holy shit Murray & Anderson have been battling for 4+ hours on Grandstand . Only the 4th set . #USOpen
Interesting that search for " goddell on http://t.co/ff4FkV0UFB brings up " Tom Brady needs to drop it and move on " as 1st result .
If this goes all the way to the 5th .... Odds lie with Murray to take the match . #usopen #SSTennis
Tomorrow kicks off Muslim Awareness Week ! Come to our first event tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. : the Brown Bag on Islam . http://t.co/OMHCbOfETY
Performing at the Red Sox game tomorrow and all I can think about is if I have enough time to do homework
Dammit , Murray just wont lie down . 4th set tie break now . @kevinanderson18 up 2-1 in sets
Murray blew it ! Just couldn't handle Anderson's first serve in the 4th set .
Superb from Anderson . Good fight from Murray as always . 2nd serve just ain't strong enough imo .
Anderson upsets #3 seed Murray 7-6 6-3 6-7 7-6 . Reaches 1st ever major QF . South African played well going for it . Longest match at #USOpen
@AndrewLightle Murray just got obliterated in the 4th set tiebreak
Murray out in the 4th Round !
6 match points in a row now for Anderson in the 4th set tie breaker ; surely Murray has lost this ... #USOpen #FlushingMeadows
Anderson beats Murray in the 4th round #USOpen2015 excellent game . #WellPlayed . http://t.co/Z2dFO2XQCs
Beginning to worry Murray may be stuck on two grand slams for the rest of his career .
Since Stan 1st grandslam , he's lost all 4 matches against Murray #USOpen Surely going to be a great match up for Stan !!
Murray can't be happy with that tie-break esp . What did he need to do better this match ? #usopen https://t.co/aThIQd6RlI
Murray is beaten before the QF of a Grand Slam for the first time in five years . Anderson , magnificent throughout , took 4th set tiebreak 7-0

@maxcouch @roryjiwani @Alex_0wen @DanBarberTF @Tennisratings Murray will never win a slam again unless he changes . 2nd serve a joke
Murray's form has been tremendous this year ... a win tonight would've seen him reach 60 victories in a season for just the 2nd time

Haven't seen TFI Friday before but it's hosted by Noel Fielding and Chris Evans ( the shit , English one ) so I want it off television soon
Anyone else thinking Chris Evans is just doing this series of TFI Friday before giving it to Nick Grimshaw ?! #scarythought
TFI Friday - not half as good as it was ' back in the day ' . All seems rather self-indulgent towards Chris Evans these days ( even more so ! )
The 1975 may as well just call it a David Bowie cover
Anyone taking their kids trick or treating tomorrow and would take Briana with them for a little while ?
Is Noel fielding having a chat on tfi Friday or is Chris Evans going to keep on rabbiting another break " groan " !!!

Lol , get a grip #royals fans . I can forgive the HRs , but he biffed that pitch to Thor and then fell apart in the 4th https://t.co/5vyHq69IQn
Thor is cruising and we are hosed ... see you all tomorrow at 2-1
Grandy showing some real nixe range our there in RF , saving a 2-out double to end the top 5th . 12 straight retired by Thor . #NYMvsKC
@ACMI 2nd visit to David Bowie Is last night and I already feel like I should be going again ! Absolutely amazing exhibition ! Thank you ! <3
Yes , Thor , I remember those 6th inning stats of yours . Let's lose them tonight , hey ? #LGM
Away . Away . Away . Syndergaard peppering outside of the plate and then busts pitches inside . Thor has found his groove . 5K . Top 6th .
I have an uneasy feeling .. last 2 times I felt this way was day before the attitude article & when Briana came to London .. I may be wrong tho
Regardless of what happens- Thor's recovery from the 1st and his middle innings here give me hope for the future #LGM #Mets
Hate to admit it but Arod is good in the booth . Interrupted Harold talking about Thor costumes for the 8th time and provides real insight
@hughcartoons he was like David Abbott's edgier younger brother . the Elvis Costello to David Abbott's George Harrison , if i may .
Thor just giving me my 16th heart attack of the night . It's okay , just some candy corn lodged in my valves this time . #LGM
Rios grounds out to end the inning . Should be all for Thor with Colon and Neise on bullpen . Still 5-3 Mets in 6th .
Finally home from all this so called shopping in time to see Thor Finish up the 6th
Thor said Thursday during press conf that he had tricks up his sleeve for tonight . It was the Warthen slider , he relied on it heavily 3 IP+
@MetsProspectHub there's no way Thor should start the 7th anyway
Thursday is Thor's day and I'm sore from the thunder of stress that I'm under
People who know baseball know Thor is the player of the game cause after the 2nd inning he started dealing and kept mets alive
Harold Reynolds talking how the 1st pitch from Thor sent a message , sure if you forget the Royals he 6 hits in the first 2 innings
Put it in the books ! Big games for The Captain , Thor , and Granderson . Let's got Matz tomorrow ! #LGM
Nice win , Thor , Captain America , and the Falcon came up big , let's even this up tomorrow . #LetsGoMets
The first one is always the hardest . Way to go Thor !! Looking to tie it up tomorrow night ! #LGM #MetsTwitter https://t.co/LPnQoXri1a
I knew Thor would get the job done . Matz on tomorrow , offense seems to be waking up , Let's Go Mets !!! #LGM
Here we go boys !!! Great job by Thor tonight !!!! And the Captain !! Huge spot for the Long Island kid Matz tomorrow .
What's nice about CY pitching tomorrow night , he won't lose focus like Ventura did after Thor singled . We can't go to a game 7 with YV
Win tomorrow and we get another shot at a 3 game set with Harvery deGrom and Thor #WontHappenAgain
@cyr Me . I am a Caitlin face tonight , but a Thor face tomorrow .
I want to dress up as Thor tomorrow and wear a Syndergaard jersey .
how about the balls on TC to stay with Thor with bases loaded to get that 3rd out !! #mets
if YoVentura had done what @mets Thor did on the 1st pitch to Esky he would have been villainized . Instead , Thor is a hero . #GoRoyals
@_mistermet @Buster_ESPN kinda hoping Matz pitches inside tomorrow , though he's a different pitcher than Thor
I knew that Escobar attacks 1st pitches , so there you go , hit this one .. Thor is a real life hero . #LGM
Thor is the man , this guy may have single handidly just turned this around with that first pitch
I like how Thor is bragging about making Esky uncomfortable as if he didn't give up 6 hits and 3 runs in 1st 2 innings .
@Lou_Pellegrino you must have heard thor's comments on the 1st pitch he's not afraid that much we know
Thor is a throw back kind of pitcher . I love it !!!! https://t.co/EAm51LNbHR
I don't understand the narrative that Thor owned the game because of that first pitch . The Royals got to him in the 1st & 2nd , right ?
Matz needs to come out firing like Thor tomorrow first pitch in the same place #Mets #MetsTwitter #MLB
I don't know who but someone is partying with fat Thor tomorrow
I'm loving all these quotes from the cry baby Royals about Thor's 1st pitch to Escobar . If I'm Matz , I'm doing the same thing Saturday .
@TwinkleMets I just heard a quote that the Royals intend to get back at the Mets for the 1st pitch tonight Please tell Curtis to be careful !
@dubs_mike80 If Escobar was hurt I would hope you would be calling for Thor's suspension . If KC throws up tomorrow , you should have no prob
Curtis will see you Saturday #playoffs

@Noahsyndergaard great game & way to make a statement on the 1st pitch . Very Bob Gibson of u . Beware of Thor the hammer will come ! #LGM
David Bowie may have tucked @MarkRonson into bed as a child -- listen -- bigtime players on the left did to Yours Truly too .
@PIITP A normal hard slide into 2nd would be comparison to Thor pitching inside , Utley comparison would be if he actually hit him in the head
@brianbuck13 no more than when Curtis or Murphy had to dive in the 1st 2 games .
@lindacohn @BMonzoWFAN Thor's single with 2 strikes leading off the 3rd is what should tick them off .

Having a really hard time processing that Connor Howell sat on the Curtis side at the game last night .
Rummel recovers Curtis fumble . It's pouring out here . Maybe the weather had to do something with that . 2:04 remaining 3rd 21-7
Fourcade loses his 3rd fumble of the day and Curtis recovers at the Rummel 28 . Curtis back in business
Curtis going for it with a 4th and 6 coming up .
Rummel takes a timeout with Curtis facing a 4th and 5 with 6:13 left in the game .
@MadDogUnleashed be honest , if Ventura had thrown 1st pitch like Thor you all would be blasting him instead drooling on yourself ? #Royals

Bing Crosby & David Bowie have been singing " Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy " in my head all day . How's your November 3rd going ?

Alright if you hate Briana ok but like just ignore her don't call her names just leave her be if we ignore this it may just leave
I'm not just saying this as a larrie but there is no way that briana is having louis ' baby . she may be pregnant but the baby isn't louis .
@Jack_Septic_Eye Do think you'll make a video on Dark Souls 3 when it comes out ? " Praise the Sun "
@TheTwoMikes AND also very importantly it was 40 years ago TODAY that David Bowie had his 1st No1 with Space Oddity ! #40SpaceOddity
In all seriousness I think we all stated how we felt about the baby and Briana way back in August there's no need https://t.co/pJ4t6jMk7p
Unless Briana was as virgin- the only thing I can tell @Louis_Tomlinson is DNA test ! She wouldn't be the 1st trying 2 trap a celebrity ...
Briana may be pregnant just not with Louis baby
Just saying Briana got pregnant when she had a bf in March/April and Louis and eleanor had just broken up isn't that just fishy

Paps : this one if for the sun !! Briana : * stands behind Louis and poses * So not set up , nope nope nope , not one bit
In the paparazzi video where they take cliche for the sun you can clearly see Louis not realising that there's Briana behind him
George Harrison , Louis Armstrong and Bob Marley on the way before 8 this morning - how's your Wednesday going ? #SmoothBreakfast
Briana may be pregnant but I'll never believe it's Louis ' until he looks happy about it lmao
briana may be pregnant but louis isnt the dad or atleast he is not excited about it you can obviously see it when he's been asked about it
Thor may be ' sexy and he knows it ' but I'm to sexy for my shirt .
Saw TRAINWRECK for the 2nd time & again found it & Amy Schumer brilliant as was the screenplay she wrote . Mel Brooks agreed . 100%
Selena Gomez presented Amy Schumer with an award and a heap of praise at the Hollywood Film Awards on November 1 .

Last face you want to see on Remembrance Sunday is Tony Blair , lying , horrible , corrupt twat . Bush's bitch
I hope Tony Blair feels shit standing there at Remembrance Sunday , cause he's partly to blame for the deaths or so many soldiers in Iraq
Has to be said Chris Evans TFI Friday is brilliant , great guests , brilliant bands and it always make me smile tbh
Tony Blair has a cheek being at remembrance Sunday , seeing as he illegally sent many young men to their death illegally in Iraq .
How can Tony Blair get invited at ' Remembrance ' Sunday and there was no invite for the Merchant Navy by David Cameron ? ' Disgusting'!

Apparently the Charlie Hebdo attacks and the Friday the 13th Massacre happened in the same neighborhood in Paris . Bad neighborhood ?
@DTT_Ehsan though to be fair , that tweet was from january after the Charlie Hebdo attacks and has since been deleted
When the IRA bombed the Baltic Exchange , The Good Friday Agreement began . Let's not waste time . Let's give ISIS a caliphate ... on Pluto . Now .

@MarrShow sorry @janem but why should Muslims have to march ? Did the Irish after IRA ? No . Maybe stop bombing foreign countries for a start ?
@rredstockings I personally think the IRA was political- injustice against Catholics may've been the motivating force . Islamists mad dogs .
@lesleyabravanel @graceheIps May I just point out that even though DT's tweet was horrendous , it was after Charlie Hebdo on January 7th
One thing we can be pretty sure of is the talks in Stormont tomorrow will do a deal to please the IRA . #NIpeaceprocess
@UFCEurope @maizing2 dana white said may getva rematch in ufc 200 rousey thought she wanted 2 finish ongoing projects .
explosive resistant passports !!! Charlie Hebdo shootings left ID card in the car . 9/11 plane hijacker's passports found . Paris c'mon .

@Jim936 not that your point isn't totally valid but he said that tweet after Charlie Hebdo not Friday . I made the same mistake

@boxingrich regardless of what he may say , a former boxer smashing UFC's biggest star last night was Dana White's worst nightmare
@Foxy_Blue 2 lone wolfs 1 in the US the IRA when did they last bomb the UK ? The terrorists may kill 1,000 ' s but your ilk are the real danger
@pstni Some may believe in Thor or nothing at all , but I believe in the risen Savior Jesus Christ .
Also , the ' not afraid ' pictures are from after the Charlie Hebdo attack from January , not after the Parisian attacks .
All three gunmen in the January attacks on the Charlie Hebdo newspaper and a kosher supermarket were French .
If I'm Holly Holm I think I go to Dana White & hold him hostage . But I may just enjoy chaos a little too much

@outmachicken @pgreysk 1st uneasyness was when he got v defensive about the Charlie Hebdo stuff , even tho he had pals patiently explaining
Well done Chris Evans , I did not think it was possible to make TFI Friday any more shit than it used to be , but you have proved me wrong
@DLoesch in a sense she did in the MMA plus she was ranked 7th and Dana White is in a state of shock . Ronda has one more shot at her
@bunnyhunter_ bahaha ! Love that idea . You could have a tornado and sun in the tree and Curtis ' face be the star at the top :)
and they don't care about the finer points that may get in way of their tirades . Reactions to that Charlie Hebdo thing were esp instructive
@crispybacon247 Look at the date . it was january 7 2014 after Charlie Hebdo . Don't be so willing to confirm your biases .

Kendrick Lamar is King right now of the rap game . Black Friday stamped it .

Which is the harder half of a song ... The 1st half of Kendrick Lamar's M.A.A.D city or the 2nd half of Meek Mill's Dreams and Nightmares ?
( taken from https://t.co/On9qkzz0Bs where the PM is clearly trying to avoid a future parallel with Tony Blair in history's view of him )
Thank you @SoundCloud for having black Friday by Kendrick Lamar
@spacegirlgail @darrenrichman all I think about w . Cate Blanchett is her odd accent in How To Train Your Dragon 2 . Films may be wasted on me
#RahulStrikes pls ask Rahul Gandhi if he forgot the 14th n 15th charge as he was referring to a piece of paper and with borrowed aggression

' Amy Schumer ' appeared on Monday 30 at the 13th place in the Top20 of Los Angeles's Trends : https://t.co/ykhfqbyfoW #trndnl
@Ed_Bradshaw @GamesnClass no the IRA grew out of oppression & internment & Bloody Sunday & Ballymurphy & kids killed by rubber bullets &
If Tony Blair pipes up tomorrow someone shoot him . Actually maybe he should and that will turn the vote !
@DPJHodges But the point is that Corbyn's sympathy for IRA is not relevant in deciding whether to vote same way as him tomorrow
@jemelehill @michaelsmith Who had the better " Black Friday " record J Cole or Kendrick Lamar ?
Cameron's comments may be overly rough on Labour MP's , but McDonnell called for Labour councillors to have kneecaps shot off by the IRA .
The sun is shining once again after the dark storm that was Ira's absence

@markberry I have a dislike of several labour MP's over their attitude to the IRA & so it may be the reason it first came to me .
The biggest victory for the IRA was Bloody Sunday . Membership surged . Bombing Syria will only do the same . Membership of ISIS will rocket .

Kendrick Lamar really hurt me at the end of Black Friday " I'm Just Playing With Y'all "
Tony Blair in the Sunday Times on ISIS : " You have got to destroy the idea as well " . A war on religion then ? How will that work .
Maybe because of this he may compliment Kendrick if they both did a collab album & might fight to hold his own might be good
Pretty sure Grammys are going to play it safe Monday and go with the no brainier picks Big Sean Drake J Cole Dr Dre Kendrick Lamar

They waiting on Kendrick like the 1st and the 15th
Like I heard so many people complain about Kendrick's flow on TPAB but loved Black Friday . When he used the same EXACT flows in that .

Kendrick and Abel cleaning up Grammy nominations , new office with dope views , and new Latrell music on the way ... big Monday
He's still new to us . If Cole & Kendrick just now getting the attention they deserve ... c'mon now . These ppl clueless https://t.co/Gy1Yio44fL
Super-happy for Kendrick today but the reality is he'll lose 90% of those nominations in February and then it's back to hating the Grammys .
But ya ... I'm just waiting for February so that Cole and Kendrick can drop their collabo album .
This may be an unpopular opinion , but I think that ever since the Grammy's snubbed Kendrick the first time , they just throwing awards at him
This day ( 26 Feb ) in 1988 George Harrison received the award for " Video Of The Year " for " When We Was Fab " .
Can't wait for the picture of Kendrick holding 11 Grammys to surface so I can be like " this is for the people in March calling TPAB trash "
Someone should suggest she READ some of Kendrick's LYRICS . It may be the 1st socially conscious experience she's EVER had #KathieLee
Charlie Wilson , Kendrick Lamar , Charlie Puth . Glad I made plans with everyone who worked with them that I would see them in Feb . God blesses
Kendrick always new content u don't know what to expect ... Cole talk the same Shiit from 1st project on every one https://t.co/AgbUNmCxP6

Mj had 12 , Kendrick with 11 on an album our culture didnt love at 1st , although grammys are hit & miss in hip hop hes influencing people
Someone said that they might snub Kendrick on all 11 nominations or he may get just 1 . If that happens then it's clearly rigged .
I may need to fact check , but I'm pretty sure that Kendrick is only the 2nd rapper to have his 1st 2 albums nominated for AOTY .
Honestly to me this really isnt about Kendrick being King . Of course it wll happen in this lameass 2015 https://t.co/3jYrYYQ5xS

oh c'mon .. how on earth is Adam Lambert not nominated for multiple awards !!?? he's far better than Kendrick Lamar !! #GRAMMYnoms #GRAMMYs
@LyleMSpencer In one respect , teams may value Zobrist more highly than Kendrick due to the draft pick compensation tied to Kendrick .
Glad Kendrick got that album of the year nom but The Weeknd though ? C'mon man ... #fb
