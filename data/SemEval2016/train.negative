Hey @TonyAbbottMHR, the Pope missed your communique on just looking after the Christians.  https://t.co/gDLUTXe6B2
@RealJamesWoods in similarly shocking news, the sun is hot and the Pope is Catholic. Can't believe there is anyone who trusts this woman.
@DennisDMZ   And now the Pope who has forgiven annulments.   I think his words were "fuck and be fucked"   I may have translated that wrong.
Why take the elevator from the 1st floor of Pope to the 2nd? Why?
Anyone else feel like Cool Pope may be in jeopardy of going down Julius Caesar-style?

Looks like Rick Perry may be the first out in the #GOP race.  He's out of money already!
Is this the end for Rick Perry? If 2011 hasn't taught him anything, he may as well campaign his way out of Federal #LOCKUP !! AND #LOSE!!
Rick Perry may be the first to drop out. Out of money.  http://t.co/zwmnwXbH0J #GOP2016
I think a big part of Rick Perry's fall is simply that he is not a sitting governor this time around. May be Jeb's downfall too.
Rick Perry may have to drop out of the race, before one vote is cast, because he has run out of money. I have mixed feelings about that.
I like Rick Perry. Wish that news was about Graham, Jeb or Christie instead https://t.co/ikEoZP6Nze

The amount of people on Facebook sharing the Daily Currant article about Sarah Palin is hilarious. (Guys, it's satire. C'mon people.)

And @whytology article 3 gives SCOTUS no legislative powers and the 10th amendment is clear. The 14th sec 5 requires an act of congress.
@jspoupart @JoeC1776 no. Congress makes laws and the SCOTUS settles disputes. In this case, the 1st Amendment lost.

@realDonaldTrump  Disappointed on your comment on SCOTUS using the 14th amend to void MILLIONS of legal votes by state citizens. Sad USA
Suggestion - get familiar with 1ST Amendment.  it pretty much strikes down all SCOTUS rulings regarding gay marriage, holiday celebrations
6th circuit &amp; SCOTUS denied #KimDavis appeals &amp; upheld Bunnings order, what the heck makes her crappy lawyer think they'll do something now?
It absolutely bothers the Liberals that SCOTUS ruled the 1st amendment applies to campaign cash as founder's intended! @cspanwj #PJNET #P2
@politibunny @brakinggnus @dangoddu @jbryant710 SCOTUS violated the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution not allowing #KimDavis #1A right
@israel4911 @Letha_Hughes It was the 14th that SCOTUS ruled was being violated in blocking marriage equality. News not your strong subject.
The SCOTUS claimed under the 14th amendment they could make the same sex marriage ruling. No matter how far you stretch it isn't there.
@SniffJenkum SCOTUS has no authority to make law. Only Congress may legislate. #SeparationOfPowers #AbuseOfPower
@cspanwj In their recent pro gay marriage decision, SCOTUS has directly violated 9th and 10th amendments of the United States Constitution.
Clerk #KimDavis is jailed because SCOTUS can see Gay Marriage in the 14th Amend. but Fed.Dist.Judge can't see religious freedom in the 1st.
1A: Congress can't make law preventing religious freedom, so SCOTUS interpretation unlawful Const Trumps case law https://t.co/f4LSUd5ENR

@LarryOConnor @GretchenCarlson U sound like the hated "smartset" now? Is #KimDavis the 1st to ignore unlawful ruling from SCOTUS in history?
Huckabee claims SCOTUS made new law on SSM. No. The equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment is more than a century old.

SCOTUS Apparently is Saying That Gays Have an Equal Right to Marriage Under the 14th Amendment.
Ohio has defined marriage as one man and one woman, if SCOTUS now writes law, guess Ohio has no law and you may marry who/what you wish.

Kinda sucks that the AC/DC concert is tomorrow cause I can't wait to see them play, but I don't want to go to school
My grandma "despises" me going to see an AC/DC concert tomorrow
Guy I'm working with probably disappointed that I don't care he's going to see AC/DC tomorrow
AC/DC is in Toronto tomorrow and I can't believe I'm gonna miss it

Damnit Amazon! When you say you're going to ship something on the 8th, I expect it to ship on the 8th!
@AmazonHelp You may please check my pending complaint with Amazon for which I write many emails and called customer care.
@Monomirror JELLY. Mine won't be here until Friday because Amazon are tight with shipping dates :(.
@VofEscaflowne this is the exact reason why I don't preorder Friday releases from Amazon. They always push it back to the Monday delivery.

I'm bummed with Amazon Prime right now. I ordered something and it was supposed to be delivered today, but it wasn't and I leave tomorrow :(
@jonk I've had several problems with Amazon Prime - Customer service has been a nightmare especially if your items are from 3rd party vendor
I'm kind of confused why my Amazon Prime stuff that shipped today isn't coming until the 19th-24th. That's certainly not two days.
"Arriving Tuesday" is decidedly the least Prime my Amazon Prime shipping has ever been. Wha happen?
Because the answer is Wednesday and that is very soon and I'm still not packed (also my Amazon Prime order didn't arrive today wtf)
The ONE time we want to use the Amazon Prime streaming and it's down... grrr ruined my Sunday night! @AmazonUK
Such a retard! Somehow managed to get another trial for Amazon Prime and I've forgot to cancel it for a 2nd time
Great, my cables have now been bumped from being delivered today to friday. Thanks Amazon Prime, really feeling the worth here.
Ordered 3 Amazon Prime items yesterday. One will arrive Saturday (2 days!), another Sunday (3 days?), the third on Tuesday (5 days???).
Yeah, I know it's Sunday delivery &amp; whatnot - and who else does that?! - but my Amazon Prime package is 3 and a half hours late... So far...
Amazon Prime is a lie. It said my stuff would be delivered by Monday. Its Wednesday, and still hasn't arrived. Tracking doesn't make sense.
Finally broke down and got Amazon Prime and the delivery on my 1st purchase as a member is late. @amazon I was expecting better.
Aftr network drop Amazon prime streaming deal for 2 more years make the show unsignable for 3rd season by anybdy but amazon.
Amazon Prime fucks me off so much, like you get really into something and then after like the 3rd season you have to pay. FUCK OFF.

This Amazon Prime Day thing is just like Black Friday, if you ignore the part where Amazon didn't put anything you want to buy on sale.
Is it just me, or is Amazon Prime Day less Black Friday and more your weird neighbor's garage sale?

@JudgeDillard Distressed over all the stuff they bought on the 15th--Amazon Prime Day.

@JCuzzy1 @Fydsy @FootyML @JimFish286 @Wolf_TicketsLFC our true par is probably 5th behind Arsenal. It might not be nice but it's the reality
An Amazon delivery on a Sunday is as unpredictable as Arsenal on transfer deadline day.

Arsene Wenger admits Arsenal must be "more realistic" about their Premier League title chances after losing 2-1 at Swansea City on Sunday.

No blues starting for England! Sound for Saturday, Chelsea are getting fucked and Jose knows it
With Chelsea's poor start to the season it could be 3 points to the 'ammers on October 24th - and I'll be there to see it
@Dan_Walsh18 c'mon bruh, you watch Chelsea every week you aren't actually gonna tell me that Oscar works harder due to tackles are you?
Everton Vs. Chelsea so early on a Saturday. These boys want to ruin my weekend. Why Lord.
@889BrilaFM Chelsea poor form is attributed 2 Jose Mounrinh as he kept faith wid jst d 1st eleven widout putin confidence in his subs. #LHSC

Damn near thinking about selling my ticket to Chris Brown show on the 19th

Why is the David Beckham so positive about the England team, we are shite if we don't hit 8/9 on Sat then that is disgraceful set of cretins
David Beckham as James Bond may just be the worst idea I've ever heard in my life
David Beckham has expressed his desire to be the next James Bond. He's a good look but his acting may be a deal breaker

After a disappointing end to the 3rd season of OITNB, now to see what Hannibal is all about.
@WatIsEyebrow noooo not yet. We had a birthday date night last night. Plus I watch it on hulu, which means no Hannibal until Sunday :/
According to my DVR, the penultimate episode of HANNIBAL is just the 4th quarter of a NFL preseason game. I could eat a face.
I thought I had enough strength for the Hannibal finale. Tomorrow is lost.
@eattherudecast I think it's Hannibal and Clarice on the run together, which I loathed, but Bryan's talk of an "inversion" may make it work
Hannibal's 3rd season feels like it became more and more a parody of itself.
Bit concerned my brother hasn't read the facebook message I sent him asking him to bring me the last 2 episodes of Hannibal tomorrow.

@bruceanderson I feel it is 2nd rate. Mansbridge doesn't point out when Harper's not answering the question. Debaters would do that.
@newbsradio let's go easy on the pigs. I just can't stand the sight of Harper. It's the 21st century...can't we teach robots to love?
@CBCPolitics Harper the CPC are going to become a 3rd place party because of your reckless leadership #stopharper #cdnpoli #elxn42

@CBCNews Trudeau may do better if he attacked the NDP, no need to waste time on Harper the Media is 24/7 with the anti Harper narrative
New election laws crreated by cpc makes it difficult to vote against Harper Even w/ 70% of voters against Harper, he may still win #fixed
so Harper is blaming Del Mar racing another meet for the summer meet's struggle.  Never change California racing.
CPC polling 3rd. Hate polls but I want to believe this. As individual CPC candidates come to realize that Harper is drag to them, Distnce?
@picardonhealth @jdvorkin Yellow journalism.  But you know?  This may be Harper's Waterloo
Harper's NEW AD I am WHO i am not perfect but depend on me for economy  Harper slip sliding down the polls-3rd We KNOW WHO YOU ARE scares US
Anyone in Niagara tomorrow should note that Harper will be in Welland. The sulfuric smell won't be coming from the Netherby tunnel for once.
@Shauncore he could, but Harper has been a freak all year, and Votto's 1st half wasn't amazing.
@MikeWAiken at any rate Harper is sinking fast he is talking resignation after 19 Oct.
@ZuckermanCSN I hope someone asks Harper why the team bailed in the 7th inning
Shame all the fans that stuck around to see a six run lead blown and Harper make an out for the 8th time in two games. #Nationals
Harper may never get a hit against the Mets the rest of his career #LGM
@TedStarkey even a successful bunt puts us right they are now 1st and 2nd 1 out after the IBB to Harper. So dumb.
@KennyHerzog In this series the Nationals may have lost the division and Harper may have lost the MVP.
@TarekFatah Mulcair, Trudeau and May are all weaklings just like Harper. Mulcair must dubious and dangerous of bunch. Apologist for Isis.

I'm sat watching the worst Harry Potter film ugh
You'd think I'd be prepared for all the anguish when reading the Harry Potter books all over again for the 10th time. Right? LIKE FUCK.
The pacing for the 4th Harry Potter movie was so ridiculously off and it ruined the entire movie.
"Hey, can you set up Apple TV so I can watch Harry Potter while I get fucked up?" --ladies and gentlemen, may I introduce you to my roomies!
@itzyourboy_ if you think Harry Potter is better ur not gunna survive as an adult lol honestly though when I went to Logan 3rd was the best
Everytime I watch the 4th Harry Potter, a part of me still thinks that maybe Cedric will return to the port-key... But he never does *cries*
We're sat by the Thames and orally retelling Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone. I am the worst at this game.
Non stop Harry Potter in our house since Friday! Make it stop!!!
I lost the 7th Harry Potter book....  I'm legit crying now  this is my childhood

Hillary doesn't want to run as Bill's 3rd term. Biden doesn't want to run as Obama's 3rd term. Both want to run as Sanders's 1st term.
@seanmdav Hillary's aides say alot of things - except the one taking the 5th. #Hillary2016
@realDonaldTrump may not be my first choice for president, but I'm voting for him if he's nominated. At least he's better than Hillary
Hillary whacker @MichaelSSchmidt rehashes the same article he wrote 6 weeks ago. NOT ONE new fact in Sept 7 piece.
#Obama and #Hillary may have used Benghazi lie to win his last election but the #Benghazi #truth will lose Hillary's http://t.co/iu2kLdkbXs
This will be the 3rd "revamp" of Hillary's campaign. Her numbers tank each time. She just sucks at campaigning in the new media world.
@realdunaldtrump Wait till Hillary throws you under the bus like the rest. Pleading the 5th?
@RufusKings1776 This must be the 20th time this old advice to Hillary has been recycled as "news."  She is who she is. That's her problem.

@IbadPoulette Remember how NYT aided Bush's March to Iraq War?  They need to be truthful &amp; they haven't with Hillary.
But on Friday she REFUSED to apologize in interview with liberal Hack Andrea Mitchell. Hillary is a phony. @CNNPolitics @HillaryClinton
If you're bored, Ask Siri, "Hillary sucks big green donkey dicks" prepare to laugh like you were in 8th grade!!
Bernie Sanders is about to torpedo any chance Hillary might have of winning the White House going 3rd party. lmao http://t.co/8ZJnDa2Iur

Hillary gets emotional over talking about her mother -  tomorrow #MorningJoe will call her a fake. @ABC
@tbridis this why people don't believe anything Hillary say this person will soon take the 5th
@ABCPolitics @ABC @DavidMuir OMGosh! HIllary still using her deceased Mom as a PROP to save herself from her own lies. ~May she RIP.
Hillary apologizes the way Kardashians wed--several times in quick succession &amp; never sincerely.

Hillary will not make history as 1st female Pres. She'll make history by being 1st Pres candidate to be indicted on criminal charges.
@davidrook Or Hillary or Sanders.  We may have to rethink this whole democracy thing if someone does not step up after the pre-season. :D
You may not have seen, but the left loves their liars, cheats &amp; traitors. Hillary is their perfect candidate! https://t.co/rP2z1upkwM
Hillary just may be that stupid, look at some of her track record screw ups. History tells it all. https://t.co/nzgqhXONTl
@KevinInABQ Also, Hillary may begin to give the perception that perhaps she may tend to allow herself to be portrayed as less than accurate.
@foxandfriends  Hillary is sorry now that she may be facing criminal charges for what they found in her email
Remember Hillary denied a server existed  ever day ! A liar for President  like Obama this Country will not survive  https://t.co/qfrjOXgSBz
@RealJamesWoods I hear that Hillary's Authenticity Czar is going on the Sunday shows.
Wait. People claim Hillary is showing her humanity because she chokes up talking about her dead mother? That may be the lowest bar ever.
Did anyone see Hillary's Server Boy actually plead the 5th or did his Lawyers only do this in the media? @TGowdySC @greta @zerohedge
Hillary can take her phony apology and shove it where the sun doesn't shine. She is only sorry she was caught it's all about power.
@OutnumberedFNC @ainsleyearhardt Hillary's 1st Tele News explan "The server I used was set up by the Secret Service 4 the Pres" Y 4gotten???

Only going by the latest game stats but think I may have made a mistake backing juventus
As things stand, the bottom 3 in Serie A are Bologna (18th), Empoli (19th); and Juventus (20th).
This is very bad for Juventus. Lose in the 1st &amp; 2nd gionarta? something wrong with formation i think.. miss Pirlo, Tevez &amp; Vidal already :(
Juventus hopeless without their 3 key players and a poor transfer window. Hope the cunts end up 5th in the league.
Juventus had two men sent off as their dismal start to defending their Serie A title continued with defeat at Roma on Sunday.
De Rossi believes Juventus may struggle to cope this season as he does not think they have adequately replaced Tevez, Pirlo or Vidal
If Draxler news is true, Juventus has been humiliated this transfer window. May be leaving without the trequartista they need and 0-2.
@morningmika what was the reason U did  not ask questions in the Kerry interview  Sat in silence When U speak it is only to mock the right
@StephenGutowski Iran may regret it. But only if it happens under a GOP President after Obama and Kerry are gone.
Obama's agenda was 2 destroy American Exceptionalism &amp; Kerry is just dumb. What language does Iran speak? We may need 2 learn it #tcot #ccot
@GulfWarVet123 @oceanbcake Never have, never will; Scumbag MBH lowlife POS maybe, but NEVER Pres. I hope the 1st Iran nuke hits him &amp; Kerry.
@webs1934 yes they do &amp; its sad that Kerry being the 1st AA woman in 40 yrs to b lead on a show was reduced to a guest star on her on show
No, Sam. The "we" in Kerry's statement is UNHCR, not the US government. Important distinction.  https://t.co/piNOmw6qbX
Never been a Kerry fan but may they hammer 7 shites into Dublin and wipe the smile off their smug little faces!
Kerry now starts begging Iran to release American hostages, Iranians laughing all the way to the bomb. # Sunday Morning Futures @FoxNews
Kremlin support of Assad regime may lead to possible"confrontation" with US led coalition:Kerry #RAAF @RodgerShanahan http://t.co/mk8ttNCGGG
@Talk2Cleo @KerryMacuska That's right, ladies. I'm blaming everything on Kerry. Cleo this show may well eclipse the numbers of @JakeNeedham
@TigonisYesis @ChrisCoon4 @ActForAmerica May I ask, have you read the bill, including the provisions that neither Congress nor Kerry saw?
@KGullic I think everyone is having trouble with it by the sounds of it Kerry. C'mon @support sort it out please
@offtheball went to QF with Kerry lad who before game hoped that dubs would not beat Kerry by a cricket score. Game over in 1st 10 mins cute
Big Rally tomorrow, again it looks like too little, too late.  Where was everyone before Kerry and Obama F'ed Up? https://t.co/idqCp02CNc
@Augustine25 @BillKristol we may elect to forget famous Iran Contra then under Bush till he declared Axis of Evil every one failed Kerry did
Americans taken hostage by Iran Houthis back in march ..Kerry kept it quiet while Iran deal was being negotiated  so Americans would approve
Turns out watching the Kurt Cobain doco when feeling edgy on an oppressively rainy Sunday wasn't a great choice. Someone bring kittens.
@itsrobotface DO NOT watch the Kurt Cobain doccie. Just don't. Self Portrait, The Cult of JG Leroy, virunga &amp; They Will Have To Kill Us 1st
Had a dream that I saw Nirvana live and Kurt Cobain sat and split his cigarette with me afterward and told me about life. Woke up sad.
I think on some day's may the spirt of Kurt Cobain be with me so I dont  bitch slap everyone
Courtney Love doesn't want photos that could prove Kurt Cobain was murdered to be released. I wonder why? http://t.co/9UfObSanU7
..more tired than Kurt Cobain on his 3rd shot of heroin after doing sets every night this week but if i can find a spot tonight i'll go up..
Smells Like Teen Spirit playing between the top and bottom of the 10th. Probably not what Kurt Cobain had in mind.
Hey all the Kurt Cobain accounts that just followed me, he died in 1994 not 1993. April 5th to be exact.
Nirvana was scheduled to headline Lollapalooza in 1994 but dropped out on April 7th. Kurt Cobain's dead body was found the next day.
According to rolling stone, Kurt Cobain is the 12th greatest guitarist of all time... Somebody actually thinks this and it hurts me.

Kurt Cobain solo is not Nirvana! Nirvana is a four-piece! How dare you!? ;) https://t.co/5BSIuBZGzR
I think, sadly, that Kurt Cobain and Philip Seymour Hoffman may have, despite their grim deaths, glamorized the drug
I'd say I want to be like Kurt Cobain but I can't bear the thought of living till I'm 27. Blow my head off with a shotgun tomorrow.
Alabama State Troopers investigated seven fatal traffic crashes that resulted in nine deaths during the Labor Day holiday from Fri. to Mon.

@SIstingrays @StevenMatteo Monday was the Labor Day holiday. We are catching up with the 11,000 tons of trash that didn't get picked up.
#SBYBuzz: This Labor Day weekend, violence continued in the District. Tuesday morning, public officials commented: http://t.co/f19A1gid4o.
The problem with Labor Day is that it makes every day following feel like a Monday.
I went to class with no paper on Monday so I had to write the notes inside my book.. That's why there shouldn't be class on Labor Day

The thing about being older is that when I see people like Miley dressing the way she does, all I think is "Meh, Madonna did it 1st."
@musikate @catawu @cmbsweden @verge sorry her shenanigans eclipse any real talent she may have..at least Madonna was strategic w/shenanigans
why does my bus driver have to start driving before I'm sat down and me make me look like madonna at Brits award
@THR She has the right to disagree. I hate Madonna! But don't think she should be stopped singing her shitty songs. 1st amendment, bro!
@HolyQueenOfPop @the_mdna_world the poor things are so jaded!  Nobody cares about gags, Madonna is going to shit on her premiere tomorrow!
Oh! So bummed @NYHiltonMidtown has no rooms avail on the 16th! Where the heck am I supposed to stay when I see Madonna?
@shockadelicaa Just until the 17th or some shit. I don't want to see Madonna spoilers.
Mama: Shoti, i bought 2 tickets to a movie, the title is MAGIC MIKE XXL i don't know why is that the but watch it with me tomorrow. Me:.....
B texted me and told me that she &amp; her mom went to see Magic Mike XXL (she loved the 1st one) and she hated it.
Omfg? Magic Mike XXL was on cinemas last July 1st and I didn't even get to see it bummer :--(
Magic Mike XXL is probably the single cringiest film I've ever sat through at the cinema.
One of my Magic Mike XXL co-workers and the coordinator of the premiere I went to on June 30 this year died... http://t.co/MsYMeianAw
I was SO disappointed with Magic Mike XXL!!! If it would have came out first, I dont think I would have watched the 2nd one.
"Saturday I saw you, holding hands with someone new..." That part does something to my soul. Circles by Mariah Carey
Well it's August 12th and I've just heard Mariah Carey's 'All I want for Christmas'...seriously?

if you can't handle me blasting mariah carey fantasy on repeat with all of the windows open on a sunday arvo then don't live in rosebery nsw
Mariah Carey: "I really haven't paid attention to Madonna since about like 7th or 8th grade, when she used to be popular." MELHOR SHADE
@lhommegirl @arzE fukkin loser it's totally abt Mariah Carey however studies show now she may be one-upped by u
It is almost 2 o'clock in the morning, I have school tomorrow and my roommate is singing Mariah Carey at the top of his lungs in the shower.
Misinterpreting Mariah Carey lyrics. Apparently she wants to fly a family into the sun and something about tachyon beams. Star Trek fan ?
I really haven't paid attention to Mariah Carey since I was like in 5th grade when she used to be popular
Nicki is always feuding with somebody. Lil Kim, Mariah Carey, Iggy Azalea, Taylor Swift, now Miley Cyrus... I like her but c'mon
Please stop acting how if you were a Mariah Carey update account. https://t.co/lPdfLTUnsT
