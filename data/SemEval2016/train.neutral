I just read a rumor that the Nintendo NX may not have an optical drive, and I'm just like, "are you TRYING to fail now, Nintendo?"
@jrconway3 @BitnerdGX Sure, it may not be in a direct sense. But Nintendo gives GX the support by sending them coverage and press releases.

@THEREALRTU but then I suppose the 3rd party ports suffer ,maybe Nintendo will use nvidia for there gfx chip... Lol
@16KTS @Flareonys Nintendo needs some more 3rd party reps, but at the same time that's what makes them pure.
@AhriAnarchy it was always a good thing but seems to scare off 3rd party devs, so Nintendo need to take the risks themselves but don't &gt;

Judge argues that since TN, per SCOTUS, can't determine what a marriage is, then it can't rule in contested divorces. http://t.co/xgocY3pvSF
Even the SCOTUS says the 2nd A can and should be restricted, David!  https://t.co/PkIUPC4wU1
@jaxx613 @MGBazemoreJr @JoeC1776 @jsavite And the Constitution says that SCOTUS decides what is constitutional.  We may not agree.
@FoxNewsLive  The Law of the land is religious freedom 1st Amendment protects RF not FRF. SCOTUS was wrong. Kate Smith is right
@jteberhard @cherry1779 The ssm isn't the issue here. That was settled by SCOTUS in June. This is about following the law
You say it's not a right. SCOTUS says it is. Constitution says we follow SCOTUS. Fucking done! https://t.co/iyANr58fvq
.@JTSoutherland What the 14th says or doesn't say is not up to you. The words have meanings. Legally, SCOTUS decides. They have.
@LizSchmidt3 SCOTUS determined that to be the 14th amendment's due process clause and equal protection clauses. #Oberfeige #readityourself
Anybody asking what law #KimDavis broke needs to sit in on a 5th grade social studies class and learn the role of SCOTUS.
Religious freedom, purposely protected by 1st A., is now trampled by the SCOTUS decision on gay marriage.#ImWithKim http://t.co/uarVbr8BE3
Nope. Look at the SCOTUS rulings on the motto. They call it ceremonial *deism*. It's not reaffirming Christianity. https://t.co/ff8ytcQBK4
@aquapub I know I'm stupid but it seems SCOTUS has established marriage as a right via 14th. Kim was denying people who legally qualified.
@rogerthatone @FarRightofLeft_ @C0nservativeGal Legally I would say yes if you accept SCOTUS decision And actually to litigate it that's 1st
@JohnHallJr @Pattyf1234 supreme law that SCOTUS uses to interpret the laws made by congress. Even then, congress may overturn SCOTUS.
lol do you think SCOTUS just sits there and eats bonbons? They ruled under the 14th AD from an ohio court ruling https://t.co/nZDHe7PHyf
@rbassilian @souperfan2013  Actually there were many laws passed by many people in the states, SCOTUS just ignored the 10th Amendment
@pnkust @USSupremeCourt Here, this will explain SCOTUS decision on SS marriage as it applied it to 14th Amend.  http://t.co/WqHlbCq9wS
@GeoConservative @peltier_maggie and SCOTUS ruled any law outlawing same sex marriage is unconstitutional for violating the 14th
(Which is why Kim lost with the 6th Circuit and SCOTUS) https://t.co/Po3u10Djn8
@scrowder What if SCOTUS says 2nd amendment arms don't mean guns and elected official disregards it?
@MichelMig0123 @CatholicLisa ...the SCOTUS could rule tomorrow that the entire Bill of Rights is unconstitutional and it would be binding!
@CorrellioRedux lol you still don't get it, Kentucky has ratified the 14th Amendment which SCOTUS says gives equal protection to marriages.
@LelandVittert clarify religious freedom in SCOTUS ruling or the 1st Amendment stands in contradiction of the ruling.
SCOTUS specifically &amp; unambiguously cited the 14th amend in their rulings on marriage equality.  https://t.co/fj8VdQG5xR
@littlebytesnews I never said it is. But the SCOTUS ruled that the 14th Amendment requires a state to license a marriage of same sex couples
@NH92276 @forgedbytrials  A majority speaks for the whole court. 4 SCOTUS judges really want to gut 2nd amendment. Should they decide.
@domnogin @AdamBaldwin @algore @MiamiHerald Gore lost the election 3 weeks before the SCOTUS took Bush v Gore. 10th Amendment argument fails
14th Amendment, EqualProtection and due process under the law, that and SCOTUS declared marriage a civil right. Next https://t.co/uG781XF909
@GuyScott33 14TH AMENDMENT guarantees EQUAL PROTECTION so yeah. Oh &amp;, P.S., no, SCOTUS didn't write the law but DID correctly interpret it.
@JSException @FoxNews  You may be right. However, Lincoln didn't listen to the SCOTUS when they said black people were not humans.
@LeeAdams_4Him purpose of the SCOTUS is to establish constitutionality of laws. they ruled that gay marriage bans violated 14th amend rights
.@tonyortegamusic @MagDods @rachelheldevans SCOTUS ruled that the 14th amendment applies to same sex marriage.
@charles_pence @CarrieKHutchens   1st found guilty of violating SCOTUS decision regarding SSM &amp; ordered to comply. Then she was in contempt
@Billd111 @megynkelly @tedcruz SCOTUS has determined that the 14th amendment guarantees equal access to marriage for all citizens
@iSupremeCourt SCOTUS would be hypocritical in re-affirming the 4th circuits ruling, but at the same time HW was kind of broad himself...
@DanThaWildMan Read the 14th amendment. Or maybe you should just read what the SCOTUS says: http://t.co/1hbUefu2l4
@topdrive496 SCOTUS says it is already in Constitution, 14th amendment.  Don't need new laws for that.
@alphainparis 14th Amendment is the one used by SCOTUS in the marriage equality ruling. @gshevlin

@angiezwick which was declared unconstitutional by SCOTUS as a violation of the 14th Amendment...so that's been settled.
@SteveThomasNow @Pontifex bottom line, it should be a Woman's Right to Privacy, as SCOTUS says, for 1st/2nd trimester only.
@JimDarcy2 @LTider @RWSurferGirl That law breaks the 14th Amendment, so it is in SCOTUS power to strike it down.
Sorry, billionaires! Might have to go all the way to SCOTUS. Pro tip: Try FULLY FUNDING your projects next time.  http://t.co/8zVJi7wBZV
@thebobbynelson if the SCOTUS decided that the 14th A gave a Muslim woman the right to no longer wear a head scarf, or that marriage
@John_16_2 @MrFuckBringer @LetsBe_Rational as the SCOTUS has interpreted it,the legislation in the 14th amendment protects same-sex marriage
@MisterFreedom You may want to learn about what the SCOTUS does.  @Petapup1
@count_01 SCOTUS based their argument on the 14th. No matter how you stretch it race was not involved.
@JAmy208 @GaetaSusan SCOTUS has interpreted equal rights under the 14th as such.
@DeepSouthProud @bryanbleano @DynaMoChen the States ensured SCOTUS could take this action by enacting 14th Amendment
@Xander756 and the 14th amendment as interpreted by the SCOTUS protects gay marriage.
@Pqlyur1 SCOTUS interprets laws, and since by their interpretation it is protected by the 14th amendment it is technically a const violation
@GovMikeHuckabee WAIT WHAT?!?! SCOTUS makes laws!?!? since when? have i been lied to my entire 8th grade year about gov? (sarcasm intended)
@npallitto @TheFive ?Regardless of your position,protocol should be followed in all SCOTUS decisions.Next time it may be one you don't like
@PragmaticEbooks In 8th grade I learned that SCOTUS rulings have the force of law. They never got that far.
@PowerCat46 Read the 14th Admendment, thats were SCOTUS says the power for Gay marriage lays. In the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection
@Israeli_Queen You are aware that SCOTUS said that it fell under two sections of the 14th Admendment right?
George on Seinfeld may be the biggest piece of shit in the history of Humanity
Tomorrow!!! I'm not moving again for a long time!! Also I feel like Elaine from Seinfeld with all these damn exclamation points!!!

Seinfeld may be the only thing that isn't funnier to me after I've had a few drinks
@HarveyAraton I may be the only human being in America never watched Seinfeld once, ditto, Friends, all those sitcoms. Only TV for sports.
Friends and Seinfeld (I didn't get cable until 3rd grade so I watched the shows on satellite) https://t.co/FsOjafAt8B

World, I think it may be time to accept that nothing Larry David did after Seinfeld has been funny.
I'm finding my life and the dialogue around me are right out of a Seinfeld episode. Many of you may think this is fun, but it's unnerving.
Stuck in the lodge with Jim the dads army loving sound guy who claims Seinfeld and Friends are the worst shows of all time. I may knife him.
@starbex Or something like NBC's "Blackout Thursday" where they had the lights come back on at 9pm because Seinfeld refused to participate.
C'mon now the only black person on Seinfeld was the lawyer who was supposed to be an imitation of Cochrane https://t.co/ZCjNFyouJz

Be fair, Cde. It's like the way my Arsenal will viciously fight any team that tries to come 4th. It's our spot.  https://t.co/tQj8eW0Ikf
I still call Arsenal's old ground Highbury. Like chuff am I going to call it anything other than the Millennium https://t.co/bB7L5nZeF6
Arsenal fans should get behind @_OlivierGiroud_ early on Saturday for his confidence, otherwise the team will be lethargic and negative.
Finding out @D6MERIT is an Arsenal fan has broken my heart a little bit. Still, going to be great to have him back Saturday.
Hopefully Shaqiri is too knackered from tonight to give Arsenal many problems on Saturday

#timesofindia .neymarjr may make Barca return against Malaga: Coach http://t.co/wowKAmUExs via TOISportsNews http://t.co/YdgpPvhn2S
Yo! Chelsea! remember when Barca said Fabregas was poo poo in the 2nd half of the season. No refunds
Vermaelen starting for Barca 2nd time in a row. Didnt think he'd play that much for them.
@mediocentroEN that he's a 4th choice CB at Barca and has started two games?
@noelle_cruz Think they put him number 3/4 These Sky Sports Pundits are pro Barca,  spent ages talking about Messi's win on Thurs.
We now just need less than 4.5 goals in the Barca match and Real match to land the 32/1 7-fold. I may cover our bet before the last match
I hope that Barca does a lot more better in the 2nd half then in the 1st half.
I honestly think what we're seeing with Fabregas is really him and why Barca were quick to part ways. Last August-November was a one-off
I can't believe the last time Barca scored against Malaga was in January 2014, that's odd. My money on Malaga to win tonight #bbceurofooty
Again, awful from Barca. Not the best result, they should get 3 goals or more. Calderon on the 12th, serious.
Pedro sat bench for Barca &amp; KDB wins POTY in Germany but yet Pedro is the "better" player.
Barca on the other hand could have problems. Must avoid injuries and stay in touch til Jan and probably add 2 more on top of Arda an Vidal
At least we won't face De Bruyne for Wolfsburg in the Champions League, or against City when they get Barca in the 2nd round
@OldTraffordReds I look at his past record 2 n it's awful nearly got barca relegated nearly finished 5th wif bayern b4 he got sacked
@RafaelH117 @DianaKristinne  do you guys think if Barca reaches January as leaders they can win the League and whether team can achieve that
@EPHowie Did you not see my reply? Barca's front 3 tomorrow. Don't EVEN @ me.
@lewis59453181 yer some Argentinian kid from Barca is flying in tomorrow, apparently Traore has told him it's good at villa.
Does Barca's transfer ban expire after tonight or on the last day of december?
@_suprene @sinTripas_ if he can play then I hope he plays against barca, on the 20th
So De Gea will be just like the Barca situation, can't play but is basically at the club because he should leave when January comes
If DDG is stuck here till Jan, can we offer him to Barca just to annoy Madrid even more.
Madrid and Barca run the La Liga, not a chance DDG won't be a Madrid player by tomorrow.
Of course it will be, When Barca can sign a player inspite being banned from signing, Why not Real get 1 minute. https://t.co/c6kXXMyfFb
@halamufc @swagattt @joelsimondsouza Personally I think Utd should just tell Madrid, the deal is gone and then in January sell DDG to Barca
Barca fans when they saw "UEFA will study the case tomorrow. They will make a decision on the De Gea case" http://t.co/BmV0wbjeoy
@tigeramer10 @SergeMUFC .. Which they won't do as they are facing a transfer ban akin to Barca. Even De Gea going January misses the CL.
Barca won the treble and had a transfer ban yet they signed two players. Arsenal came 3rd in the BPL and they didn't buy an outfield player
@The__Fundraiser Barca turned down the opportunity and experimented with Suarez. Bayern haven't opened a cheque yet[Have 1st preference]
@RafaelH117 he's a fraud who will be gone by May. Bet you weren't saying this when he was at barca
Ben Lederman may well end up being the first American to play for Barca but, for the time being, it sounds like he's heading to Florida.
@bluekippercom @edmunddafox he's off to barca in January
Atletico Madrid is going to be dangerous..Pedro leaving is going to hurt Barca in the long run..no bench to rest MSN https://t.co/TD02TABov8
.@http://pinurl.co/MakeMoneyWithGooglejr may make Barca return against Malaga: Coach http://t.co/u00NuZqQAt
Yea, just play for U21 when the club asks, u may had won a lot wit Barca but that is past, tis is Unitedddd(Spartaa) https://t.co/E2H731h3uZ
Can only mean one thing: he is joining Barca - probably in January.
@FCBMJohnKJ psg could be the 2nd best team in the world behind Barcelona but they always get Barca lol, so we would never know
@haidar_altaie @FootyQuestions1 Exactly. Only reason Torres even came back into the lime-light were for 1st minute goals vs Madrid &amp; Barca
Arda Turan got cramp, I am not surprised! Sign for Barca but can't play til January, what do you expect lol
@andrewmperry the thing though is if pogba ever does leave juve it will be to barca, also my team isn't in 13th place right now.
We are not Real Barca or Bayern that players would be ready to join the club as a 2nd/ 3rd choice. On what grounds would you bench Coq/Santi
Neymar was always gonna be something special. I honestly hate his role at Barca, he might be good, but he has to play 2nd fiddle to Messi
Barca want midfielder, forward in January http://t.co/aYwD4sNFpm

So, as someone who just got the Game of Thrones 2nd ed LCG, what websites should I be going to for decklists, discussions, etc.?
I'm just going to have to delete all social media in the time between the releases of the 6th series and the 6th book of Game of Thrones
@MarkKreidler I'm one of the few who agree with you about Game of Thrones. I also tried the 1st season and gave up. Dark doom and gloom.

Jerry Vance may no longer be a Conservative candidate but maybe Harper can name him to the Senate. #elxn42
Unpopular opinion:  Harper is right to think Nats fans ditching in the 7th inning was brutal.  No sure he was right to say it though.

yeah, Harper went 0-3 tonight. that doesn't mean he doesn't have every right to call out every single fake nats fan that left in the 7th

Harper,s high standards for candidate selection, Dauphin Swan River MP running for the 3rd time un nominated, stamped by Harper
But for the first time since the writ was dropped, I really have no idea whether Harper will be PM after Oct 19th, or who would replace him.
@GUBLERNATION "Harper" looks tired. Do you ever sleep? Then again, I should be too. I have to get up early tomorrow.
@jenditchburn It's happened. Harper may try again. What said last night won't matter, it's cling 2 power by whatever means or pogey. #elxn42
@jenditchburn Harper's a 1 trick pony.  Throwing $ from a helicopter doesn't make up for clear lack of CPC vision.  3rd place &amp; dropping.

Harper upset with fans  http://t.co/29S9C9Suk6  When @Bharper3407 runs out every routine grounder to 2nd then he can complain about the fans

Do #mets walk Harper if rendon gets bunt down?  Is Matt Williams under the weather? Pap in 8th facing bottom of order? Left storen out 2 dry
Harper doesn't want to see you leave unless you're stretchered off. #brutal  https://t.co/EKEi9TOC4A
@SBNationMLB @SBNation The idea that the Mets would have walked Harper if it was 1st/2nd no outs in lunacy.

Nope. Still half-asleep. More dancing. Seems like a Madonna sort of Monday, so on with a Bonus Song of the Day:  https://t.co/D3gxkxHngb
@AndThatsMadonna @tiknamonster @BloodyBurqa @AidanUnderYou Madonna's albums may flop, but she can still gross high from a tour nowadays.

@alauwasser If it keeps making money for HBO, they may have to start going to former colonies as well. Or even have to take Madonna.
Why did you keep Madonna 4th in that grossly inaccurate tweet #AskMusicNews_Facts

@sabinasmitham nobody wants to see you panting in the shadows over Magic Mike XXL at 2pm on a Monday.
Sitting at home on a Saturday night watching Magic Mike XXL in bed with my dog and a pizza box wondering why I'm still single.
Would it be wrong to watch Magic Mike XXL for a 2nd time?
@guardianfilm I think they may have used up all the sexy earlier in the summer with MAGIC MIKE XXL

I'm a Mariah Carey fan kaya may high standards ako. Elha's quite good altho it's not a whistle tone. DARREN Wows TVKFinals
I'm not sure which is funnier - the coloured-vinyl reissue of Mariah Carey's Christmas album or the fact that it's coming out in October.
@AfroUnique and I once sat in a Walgreens parking lot attempting to sing Mariah Carey's "My All" and probably scared the neighbors
gonna make a mariah carey cover tomorrow
Can't believe Mariah Carey's "All I want for Christmas is you" is playing right now.  It's September 3rd.

They may be different types of players, but don't say Messi and Ronaldo are the best. Not yet anyway. They might be remembered that way
@THEHOLYDEATH_7 tbh this game is bunk...I just wanna watch Monday's game with Messi
Tomorrow Getafe-Barcelona (Copa del Rey). Looks like Messi will start on the bench for the 3rd consecutive time
@DerekRichards @MarkWarburton9 Is that Messi's twitter name or has the Mexican sun fried your mind?
Sunday Supplement. Is Bale in the same class as Messi and Ronaldo?! "He's knocking on the door" don't make me laugh. Over hyped as always

Mascherano and Messi, who didn't start for ARG against BOL on Friday, are expected to start the friendly against MEX on Tuesday. [via sport]
Luiz Adriano (Shakhtar) scores his 5th goal of the evening and equals Messi's record of most goals by a single player in a UCL match
Messi and Mascherano could start the Argentina game against Mexico on Tuesday in Dallas, Texas [sport]
@Omsondafivenine @Footy_Jokes this is the truth my friend while messi might win the 5th ballon d or people would say Ronaldo didn't win it
*talking to Gunny about who's playing tomorrow*  Me: Messi and then some Mexicans that you don't know  Gunny: that's okay. I like Mexicans
Sum chelsea fans in their dreams believe Hazard is the 3rd best player in the world afta Messi and Ronaldo. Not sure they've heard of Muller
Neymar was always gonna be something special. I honestly hate his role at Barca, he might be good, but he has to play 2nd fiddle to Messi
He can't dribble cos in Spain (like many EU countries), dribbling is seen as disrespectful, he has to play 2nd to Messi...

The Nats may have sucked again but now Messi is on TV and Colbert is back in an hour so it could be so much worse.
@FCBarcelona @LuisEnrique should do everything in his power to keep Messi from walking onto Jerry's cabbage patch field in the 2nd half.
Messi slips on sod laid over turf. Grass pitches all over US, this is stupid &amp; dangerous. Glad Kun has sat the first half. #MCFC
Messi needs to show up more in the 2nd Half. #mexicovsargentina
Somebody get a mustache, a fake birth certificate and get Messi signed up for the US on October 10th, please.
So according to my 12th Grade English teacher Messi has now tied the game up? Can anyone confirm this?
@randomhero23 because they did not reply the play as much. 2nd time Messi scores a goal on Mexico like that
APOEL can become the 24th different opponent in UCL against which Messi has scored at least 1 goal. He has faced 31 teams in total
Messi and Barcelona are preparing for the league game against Osasuna at the Camp Nou this Sunday (kick-off 17:00 CET)
Luis Enrique looks set for a defeat if he calls Messi and Mascherano for training straight on Friday Just one day before the game
@Walter_Tactics @Vibidius and for the CL he scored tap-ins after Messi and Suarez had already finished the ties in the 1st legs + the final
In 2 days Barcelona will play the 1st UCL group stage game of the season, at home vs APOEL. It will be Messi's 31st opponent in Europe

Messi and Barcelona will resume La Liga action with a traditionally tricky trip to Real Sociedad (Sunday, kick-off 21:00 CET)
Top 3 players in the world? Has to be: Suarez/Ronaldo/Messi.  Only reason Messi is 3rd is because he's not proven in EPL. La liga is poor
You may dislike either Messi or Ronaldo, but you can't dislike Zlatan.
May as well scribble out the 5 on the FIFA 15 disc and replace it with a 6. Basically identical bar Bale's hair &amp; Messi's tattoo. Shambles.
