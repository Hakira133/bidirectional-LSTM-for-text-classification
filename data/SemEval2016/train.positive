If @MsCharlotteWWE defeats Nikki Bella at #nightofchampions, it Should be similar to how Ric Flair beat Dusty Rhodes to win his 1st title
The notion Nikki doesn't "deserve" to break the record is laughable. AJ wasn't Ric Flair. Hell, Nikki may be better now than AJ ever was.
22 years ago I saw Ric Flair wrestle at age 3, in the very building I'll see @MsCharlotteWWE wrestle in tomorrow night. Mindblowing!!

@magicalvidyacat Seems fitting that there's a parallel there, and that SCOTUS used 14th Amendment to override the 10th. @Rinaxas
.@marklevinshow's Friday first hour focused on the SCOTUS unconstitutional redefinition of marriage, and the case of #KimDavis. Excellent!
@A10Jim @ninaland @WoodhullSFA And that's why SCOTUS has the last word on what laws states may enact and enforce. Hence "Supreme Court."
@chrisbraly   SCOTUS never made law they interpreted it. 14th A guarantees equal rights for all Americans

Seinfeld's "the contest" may just be one of the best episodes ... #andthenthereweretwo
@kanani_lol what a waste. It even has the last man on earth, Seinfeld, South Park and Monday night raw. Hulu is awesome
@NACHO2813 @Joe_Schmucc But he is shirking the gap between him and Eddie year by year. No one is catching Seinfeld, but he may catch Eddie.
@morganameridius @disquietus now back in the day I watched a good bit. Friends, Seinfeld, 3rd Rock, 70s show. But as I got older not much
Little brother just asked me if I'm down to binge watch Seinfeld...there goes my Sunday night lolol.
@becky666 I've been watching Seinfeld since like the 5th grade
@TheBestMicah Hulu you say? This and Seinfeld alone may be worth reactivating my subscription
@sigridellis I may have read that in the way that Seinfeld greeted Newman.
@sethhinz haha! Seriously, though, it reminds me of the Seinfeld character Jimmy. "Jimmy liked worship this Sunday."  #chsocm
@Seinfeld2000 something has been bugging me lately. What if Seinfeld was current day? What if brand new episodes came out every Thursday?

#Barca Did Florentino Perez make the schedule in La Liga? Barca's 1st 4 away games all against top 8 teams; RM plays Sevilla &amp; 3 creampuffs.
@jodynotjodie Same. Knackered. I'm going into town tomorrow to watch it. Probably go Barca on the locks. Where you watching it?!

@cottonballfc very true I wish they would accept but I think we have a shot to get him in January and fight Barca for him what do you think?
Barca may have the best players, but they are miles away from having the best team. Look at that shit def. #barca https://t.co/N3uFl2XIam
@ChampionsLeague @FCBarcelona barca will successfully defended the title, with the arda and aleix in January plus MSN I don't see them lose.

Dierks Bentley and Eric Church at @countryconcert! Happy 22nd birthday to me! Is it July yet?
Murray has given it his all, which wasn't expected after the last few days he has had but Federer just unbreakable. TB 2nd set. #CincyTennis
Federer stays winning. Into the finals tomorrow.
Federer beats Murray 6-4, 7-6(6) to reach #CincyTennis final. He'll be going for his 7th title vs Novak Djokovic, who is going for his first
Way to go Roger. Old man Federer just keeps rolling along. #Djokernole v. #Fed for the final tomorrow. #CincyTennis
Djokovic v Federer should be good one tomorrow. Fancy the Swiss, can't see Djokovic coming back if he falls behind in this one.
Federer will play another final tomorrow. This guy is just amazing. #CincyTennis
Excited for the Federer vs. Djokovic final in Cincinnati tomorrow afternoon. Should be some great tennis!
Serena punches her ticket to the finals in straight sets. Joins Djokovic and Federer in tomorrow's #CincyTennis singles finals. Decent trio.
Love this new trick that Federer has when he is facing a 2nd serve. Running up to the serve line and taking it early is unreal!
Some outrageous shots from Federer in the tiebreak. The clean half volley return of a Djokovic 2nd serve just about the best of them.
Federer breaks early in the 2nd set! Even consolidates the break! Up 3-0! #RF #Tennis #CincyTennis
Federer's a man with a mission... 7th one coming.. #CincyTennis
Tiger, Federer, Serena, the Niners (eesh about those guys), and some cold TX brews. laaazzzy birthday Sunday.
For the 1st time, Federer has beaten No.1 and No.2 players in the ATP Rankings in consecutive matches en route to a title. #CincyTennis
Federer is my 2nd fave male tennis player of all time right after the great Arthur Ashe.
What a great day for world sport: Usain got his 9th gold, Federer claimed Cincinnati Title no 7 and I pumped some weights. #truepro
New @TennisPodcast tomorrow, reviewing Federer, Serena and the pre US Open storylines. This is what we sound like https://t.co/2x0O2UDCe8
Add to the results, Federer over Djokovic  and Lewis Hamilton, and it's not a bad Sunday at all!
23rd of August was such a nice day, England lift Ashes, Bolt won 100 m and Federer beats Djokovic in Cincinati.
"Papa you need a hat" thus said one of Federer's twin girls.......congrats again for winning Cinci for the 7th time @rogerfederer
Federer overtakes Lendl for second longest streak of being seeded at the US Open in the Open Era. 15th straight year. Connors leads with 18.
@ViVi_RFObsessed Looks clear cut for Federer though. But 3 sets may be a critical   variable when he plays against Stan or Murray
All though Federer will probably obliterate the 4th quarter I think Gasquet 200/1 looks big #usopen
@livetennis I believe Federer has a good chance of winning the title for the 6th time but he needs to hold his composer against djokovic!
Federer is looking good after winning Cincy for the 7th time.

I believe #Rafa could win a 3rd #USOpen title if he can make it to the semifinals at least because of Federer, Murray, etc. #usopenworld
@oreillyfactor @realDonaldTrump @ThePeople4Trump @mikecahall1  the U.S. Open is rockin..Nadal tonite, Federer tomorrow
How to watch Federer and Murray on Tuesday at the 2015 US Open: Roger Federer will begin his 2015 US Open on T... http://t.co/GlxQkdiJZN
@Jim_Hulbert Federer faced the highest ranked guy in R1. His draw is tricky. So is Murray's.If Fed reaches the QFs, then he may meet Berdy.
I'll go to the office 2h hour earlier and watch Federer's game tomorrow!
Yes, Federer's attacking return is brilliant.  But yes, it's a play club players can do too, esp. off weak and predictable 2nd serves
Not going to be able to watch Federer's match vs Darcis but expect to wake up tomorrow to read of a comprehensive victory for the Swiss.
@camerondallas Federer is about to begin his 2nd round. Go watch it.
Darcis stops the bleeding by winning his 1st game since 1-0 in the first serve. Well, one kind of bleeding because Federer's still leading.
Federer is about to be done with his match in the same time the 5th set of the Hewitt vs. Tomic match takes!
Jo Konta's win over Muguruza was the longest ever Women's #USOpen match &amp; the 1st set alone lasted as long as Federer's entire match! Woah!
Federer defeats Darcis 6-1 6-2 6-1 to advance to 3rd Round at the @usopen accomplishing a perfect 16-0 in 2nd Round
Last year, majority of the Federer matches took place primetime.  This year, it's the other way around.  2nd on Ashe tomorrow
@SJauhar I keep trying to book as soon as I learn when Federer's playing - too late. Nosebleed seats for 4th round (!) going at $250.
The 1st week of the 2015 #USOpen is almost up &amp; the big names of Serena, Venus, Djokovic, Murray, Federer &amp; Wawrinka are still in the draw.
@mmunro91 I may have never seen a player play a higher tennis level than I just saw, Nadal, Federer and Djokovic included. Make no mistake,
Fognini is I believe only the 3rd one to beat Nadal 3 or more times in a year - the others (no points for guessing) Federer and Djokovic.
Federer breaks the Kohlschreiber serve!! Federer is on red hot form &amp; doesnt look like stopping. Fed leads 2-0 in the 1st set #USOpen
Good starts for Federer and Stosur. Berdych level at 1-1 after winning the 2nd set!
Wow, tragic start from Federer in the 3rd
Just like in the 2nd, Federer breaks back.
Roger while having trouble with serve, he is still through to 4th round! Federer might face Isner in 4th round
@JohnIsner I concur with your coach. Its you! #AmexTennis Good luck tomorrow against Federer!
Federer defeats Kohlschreiber 6-3 6-4 6-4 to go through to the 4th Round @usopen
Federer advances into fourth round at US Open: In the blazing New York sun, Federer seems to be in his element... http://t.co/CoiDuhKlL4
@rosequartz0518 @_claudiaw Beep beep...! Yep, Murray and Federer into the top 16. Phew! :) See you tomorrow!
Monday at the US Open: Murray, Federer &amp; Konta are all in action at Flushing Meadows today http://t.co/50ZM0cOEjT http://t.co/YlLS4kf0of
Federer's second serve placement is awesome. That's why he's the best server ever. Nobody has better placement on 1st or 2nd serve
Gonna have to DVR this Isner and Federer match... This thing is good. Getting ready to head to a tiebreaker in the 1st set. #USOpen2015
Federer saved 4 BP (from 0/40) and holds for 2-2 in the 2nd set.
Ok time to check back in with tennis - Isner and Federer heading into a 2nd tiebreak
Federer just ended the 2nd set with a couple of ridiculously good shots.
Federer rebounds from 3-5 down in the 2nd set tb to take it 8-6. Leads Isner. 7-6(0) 7-6(6) #usopen
I watched Federer calmly destroy a dude at the US Open on Thursday, and it was amazing. I still thought "you're not sick of this dude yet?"
I believe the loss at RG to Wawrinka was first time in a decade Federer didn't break once in a GS match. This might be the 2nd. #USOpen2015
That ending of 2nd set TB by Federer, he really is the original son of Jor-el
Wow, Federer wastes 3 bps with 3 Isner's 2nd serves. Fed 0/8 on bps tonight
Federer's 1st serve is just...perfect. #USOpen
Federer just won his 15th straight point on his serve... Lol wow
@NerdistMom It's weird that in the 1st set Federer &amp; Isner went game for game until the tiebreak. Then Federer trucked him in the tiebreak
Federer breaks his own record with a 14th appearance at the ATP Finals after reaching the US QF #FinalShowdown http://t.co/ugI3PQBp8w
With his consistency in playing great tennis, i am sure Federer will crush Gasquet in the QF. C'mon Federer!! http://t.co/LHCEhZo26g

@theofficialmads may I say sir your portrayal of Hannibal is beautiful and haunting. Hope you get this message. Look forward to ur next work
I may have a massive love-hate relationship with Hannibal but Bryan Fuller's heart has always been in the right place.
I'm going to be so tired tomorrow but all I want to do is reblog Hannibal related stuff on tumblr. *cries* #Hannibal
Binge watched Hannibal all night and I may have just checked under my bed for a killer. #adultlife
@wylerette it may be called Hannibal but the show does revolve around the both of them plus bryan said they are meant to stay together
We've got to wait until Wednesday night here in the UK for the Hannibal finale yet I've pretty much seen it all in gif form
I'm crying! :O  Thank you @NBCHannibal for giving Hannibal a home for 3 years, and doing your best to keep it there  https://t.co/QJCCTlhNFS

Hi @FANEXPOCANADA - I noticed in the Guide app that there's no mention of the Hannibal photo op on Sunday. Is it still running? Great job!
@eddus We've gone for Hannibal over trash but still, lazy days! Am excited to see you and catch up tomorrow. Hello to R.
@BryanFuller Just rewatching the 2nd series finale of Hannibal for the nth time. Not enough words to explain how much it all means to me!
@alfredosaucyy it was on thurs :/ it was a last minute secret show at club bahia. it was so dope! Hannibal and donnell rawlings came thru

#Hannibal has been a brilliant series tho &amp; the fact we don't know if Hannibal is still alive leaves door open for a 4th season #Hopefully
@Vortex566 oo I need to get back in to Hannibal! Did season 1 then just kind of stopped. Yar, started last week. You got kids in tomorrow?
I'm getting up at 6 tomorrow so I sticked in and out Hannibal after I realized next episode has the girl waiting under beds to murder people
Holy shit I just now opened the Hannibal's Kitchen envelope someone handed me Friday night #dragoncon #Hannibal http://t.co/v8DX9Jl0Pv
@Illessa Based on the 1st ep, Mr Robot seems a good series to go on to.It looks to respect the audience in the same way as Hannibal, a least
@Amirabiabdallah Dexter is great but give Hannibal another try, it gets better after the 5th episode :p
@filmgrabber Michael Marshall shot the hell out of the Hannibal finale. (This movie rules. Loving Maddin Monday)
While I was at Taco Bell I got to thinking about Hannibal. I might not be ready to watch the finale but MAYBE I could watch the 2nd to last.
OK so maybe I'm watching, for the 1st time, the 1st episode of the 1st season of Hannibal and OH MY LORD WHAT IS THIS
@LowriBearman Thank you my love! And I have had a fab day! Distinct lack of Hannibal but I'll put that right tomorrow! xx
I'll be sending off Summer and HANNIBAL tomorrow. It'll be a bittersweet day.
@JohnC1908 I pretty sure none of those fans regret not being there to see Harper strike out in the 9th on a pitch in the dirt.

I hope all the fans stayed into the 9th to watch Harper go 0-5. #nats

@SouthpawSlinger @jonmorosi @FOXSports @FS1 But he's certainly been the 1st or 2nd best player in the NL overall, Harper and Kershaw better.
@RedPorchReport Harper putting up historic numbers. Thus far it's been a series to forget at the plate, but, again, he didn't pitch the 7th.
@EvanLSolomon Harper gets first chance, most seats won get 2nd chance. Easy. Harper does not play well with others, ask Danny Williams.
@ian_wayne @P_Wog   Keep focus on Harper&amp; all these good things will be added unto you May the best man who wins the heart of Canadians

@TSandizzle Just remember, I'll be picking out my new iPad for you to buy me tomorrow.
I hope they announce something different and exciting for the iPad tomorrow. It's just about time for me to get a new one #AppleEvent
Reading @daringfireball's prelude to tomorrow's Apple event, can't help but think @gruber is the new WSJ, Bloomberg, or NYT re: iPad news.
Traded in the new computer to get an iPad. Uncle tells me new iPad will be announced tomorrow so prices should drop. http://t.co/3Xgg14mX62
Apple's Keynote is happening tomorrow at 3am!With the expected announcement of the iPhone 6S, new Apple TV and iPad who is waking up for it?

#Apple to unveil iPhone 6s, iPad today. For the first time they are releasing on Wednesday. All their earlier releases were on a Tuesday.
So tomorrow is the big Apple event. What do you think we'll see, iPad Pro? An iPad Stylus? Curious to see what they bring.
@LOHANTHONY my moms taking my iPad away tomorrow but it's worth it because I'm tweeting the KWEENT #ANTHONYCHAT
Which is more interesting unveil tomorrow? $AAPL 6s, Ipad, TV or $TM new Prius? I'm going with Prius.
To prepare for the #AppleEvent tomorrow I am reminiscing over legacy apple hardware including iPod 2nd Gen, iPhone 4, iPad 2. Get Pumped!
Sundays vlog is processing, Monday's is exporting... You know for having to do it all on a iPad is say I'm doing pretty good.
@film_girl I'd buy the next iPad if they had Fassbender give the keynote tomorrow.

Sitting in my office, window open, sun shining in, listening to my ipod, wondering exactly what the catch is with this job.
1 gud thing about losing my phone is that it made me use my iPod which has all the songs I used listen to in 3rd year
I drenched the old iPod nano (6th gen) in isopropanol and it actually worked! The screen will never look the same but totally worth it.
Found my old iPod from like 7th grade and am now realizing I listened to some hood tunes for just a kid!!
I got a new ipod today! hooray! the 6th gen (gold) and ordered my case just now.My life is complete!
may or may not have just found my old iPod w/ JB, Mariah Carey, &amp; Kelly Clarkson on it

@amitbhawani @geekyranjit  ...what are your thoughts about Apple's iPod touch 6th gen?
@jroberts332 @jobot935 [2/2] That's why my Prog/Indie/Heavy Rock-filled iPod has One Direction's 3rd and 4th albums on it. I am Not kidding.

#FF @innocent - not just for the drinks but for Jay-Z's 99 problems! 99 problems that we may just ponder about at some point in our lives!
Sitting at a curb staring at the White House Listening to jay-z.thats a fine Friday
For those who may not know, Jay-Z wrote the verses for Still D.R.E but he's never disrespected Dre or ever spoken about ghostwriting.
December 4th only cause I used the beginning in my Jay-Z speech for class https://t.co/5bw2R2xGvo
Was hoping this would escalate to be something like Nas vs Jay-Z but Meek got KO'ed in the 2nd round lol

Meek drooped like a Jay-z album the 2nd &amp; 3rd time you hear it. You will understand it and Fall in love with it
I was in like the 4th, 5th, 6th grade burning CDs and mixtapes that faithfully consisted of Dipset, old Bone Thugs, and hella Jay-Z
Jay-z may not be the best looking guy, but he proves to others that looks aren't everything

the 1st dance at my wedding will actually just be a duet of Diamonds From Sierra Leone-Remix with my husband as Jay-Z and myself as Kanye.
Aye now Meek may surprise us. You know when Jay-Z dropped Takeover they thought it was over for Nas. And then Ether......
May the best of your today be the worse off your tomorrow - Jay-Z

Talib, Jay-Z, Kanye, T.I, Big Pooh, Dela, J Dilla, Nas, Pete Rock, 9th Wonder and the legendary Slum Village.
Personally handing Jay-Z jerseys may be the highlight of my New York existence. First time I've been star struck.
From now on I'll try to be more sympathetic towards Freemasons like Jay-Z. When you come from nothing European culture may look like heaven.
Jay-Z and Beyonce came to Taylor's 25th but not Kim and Kanye's wedding. Imma let Taylor finish, but she had the best birthday of all time.

"We make a million of beats, cause our stories is deep. And fuck tomorrow, as long as the night before was sweet." - Jay-Z
Only looking forward to Kanye's performance at the VMA's tomorrow! Heard he's bringing out Rih, Bey, Jay-z &amp; Paul McCarthy
I was certainly not expecting @JColeNC to bring @Drake and Jay-Z to the Ville.  I may have dropped a tear or two.  Greatest show ever!
If Kanye became President, folk that wrote off the masonic/illuminati symbols in he and Jay-Z's music/vids as meaningless, may think again!
Today during 6th it was dead silent in the library &amp; all of a sudden my iPad started blasting Jay-Z's voice saying "Motherfucker I got this"
Also the correct Top 5 is Eminem, Jay-Z, 2Pac, The Notorious B.I.G., and Ice Cube in that order with Big Pun as the 6th man
Jay-Z sat in that Interview like a God showing that he was truly ahead of his time while the other niggas flirting with Foxy Brown

Jurassic Park may just be my favorite arrangement of all time. And John Williams may just be my favorite composer of all time.
No joke, but #MyScienceStory is that I read Jurassic Park in 3rd grade and was thereafter obsessed with biology.

Jurassic World was excellent the only way it could have been better is if @nlyonne was Karen &amp; Claire's 3rd sister http://t.co/TmmcliThHY
The last scene of Jurassic World may be one of the best scenes ever
@cushbomb well his belief that Jurassic World is the 2nd best film of the year pretty much proved that
The vine of Chris Pratt on the set of Jurassic World makes me happy, even if I saw it way back in May....

Magic Mike XXL is better than the 1st. I learned a lot about the male stripper psyche &amp; culture (&amp; midlife crisis), &amp; female sexual desire.
Yes, Magic Mike XXL is a feminist movie, but the reason may surprise you http://t.co/3r5JTNDLMa
A FB friend of mine just posted that seeing Magic Mike XXL was the best night of her life. If only she knew what my typical sat night is.
What is this force that compels me to keep watching Magic Mike XXL? Saw it the 2nd time yesterday and am already ready to see it again.

Javier Saviola: "I'd be delighted if Messi won his 5th Ballon d'Or because of the quality of his football and because of our friendship."
Messi has ALWAYS scored in the 1st or 2nd leg of the CL Round of 16 since the 2007/08 season: 2 - 1 - 2 - 2 - 6 - 2 - 1 (ongoing)
Bale is a great player, Messi may have to drag with him this season, and I think Bale feels strong.
